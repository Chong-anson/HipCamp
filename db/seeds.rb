In winter (Nov 20th - May 21st), access is by over-snow vehicles such as snowmobiles (with proper experience), backcountry skis (with proper experience), snowshoes, or some combination.

Check local fire bans (Eagle County and White River National Forest) before burning!Expect to have no cell service along the way so if you're using Google Maps, we would suggest downloading the area map to your phone before taking off. A printed topo map is an excellent item for your pack as well.  There are several different routes you can take when getting to the cabin, which you will pass in this order as you go along the 703/ Homestake road and you'll see outlined in detail further below. Please research these when planning your trip:1. Hike in from the start of Holy Cross City Road (road 759) (3.7 miles, 39.403140, -106.443517)2. Hike in from Fancy Pass Trailhead  (~4.4 miles, 39.390546, -106.470555)3. EASIEST ROUTE: Hike in from intersection of 727 and 759 (2.5 miles, for getting here you should have 5-8+â\u0080\u009D clearance and AWD, as the 727 road is a somewhat tricky drive and not appropriate for most compact rental sedans), 39.409698, -106.455588)Note: For winter the best  route is on  Homestake Reservoir Road (road 703) for about 7-7.5 miles from the closure  to the 759 Holy Cross City jeep road and then up to Holy Cross City Directions:1. Off highway 24, take Homestead Reservoir Road (road 703).2. Drive about 7.8 miles and take a right onto Missouri Creek Road (road 704). Note: before Missouri Creek Road, your GPS may try to take you to the right up Holy Cross City Road (road 759). Unless you have a high clearance, off-road vehicle, we would not turn here. However, you can hike in from this point. Please check signs regarding current parking restrictions if you choose this option. 3. Drive 2.2 miles and take a right on Fancy Creek Road (road 727). For this road you may want a good Colorado trailhead vehicle like a Subaru, unless you are used to driving your lower-clearance vehicle on narrow and at time challenging  forest roads.

Please be considerate of others.We have also opened our Klamath Riverview Yurt for folks who want a full kitchen, a private shower and flush toilet overlooking the Klamath river from the 50 x 50 foot upper deck.

Sometimes we see timid black bears who run from humans but sometimes can be seen grazing in the meadow with the black-tail deer. We are surrounded by old logging trails made by the lumber companies 80 years ago when they clear cut the old growth redwood on our side of the mountain, and now it's completely reforested with 200 ft tall Doug Fir, Madrone, Cedar, Oak, other pine species and Pepper wood trees.MORE ABOUT OTTER SPACE...The Otter Space Conference Center was purchased in 2002 by Dr. Peter Alsop as a place of peace and healing, where human service professionals come to train with Dr. Alsop and learn how to help children and families cope with issues such as chemical dependency, loss and grief, child abuse and trauma. We are located on the Yurok Indian reservation right on the Klamath River just outside Orick, CA. The name Otter Space comes from a family of otters that live just down river. Itâ\u0080\u0099s also combination of â\u0080\u009CArtistâ\u0080\u0099s Spaceâ\u0080\u009D and â\u0080\u009COuter Spaceâ\u0080\u009D and implies the importance of thinking â\u0080\u009Cout of the boxâ\u0080\u009D and valuing music and the arts in healing and living our lives fully, as well as the need to pass on earth and people-friendly skills to help our children survive into the future.Our Main House was built in 1952 and retains the flavor of the 50â\u0080\u0099s. It houses a kitchen, dining hall, a living room, two bedrooms and a bathroom with a bathtub and shower. It currently houses Joe and Wendy Moore and their three children. Joe and Wendy live sustainably off the land and offer workshops on a number of sustainable practices. They will be available to help if help is needed. They also have emergency phone service to the outside world, … emphasis on â\u0080\u009Cemergencyâ\u0080\u009D.

Depending on the size of your vehicle, you may be able to park in the meadow, next to your camp, or up at the main house, and pitch your tent in the site youâ\u0080\u0099ve reserved.TIMES  Please clean up and check out of your site by 11:am on the day of your departure. You can check in by 1:p on the day of your arrival.CLIMATE & THE KLAMATH Otter Space is in what many call the â\u0080\u009Cbanana beltâ\u0080\u009D of the Humboldt rainforest. Plan on bringing layers of clothing as temperatures can go from hot and warm during the day, to quite cool and even cold after dark. The Klamath River is swift moving (usually about 7 knots, and strong). It runs 286 miles from Klamath Falls, OR to the sea. There are four tributaries: Scott, Shasta, Trinity and Salmon Rivers. Swimming in the summer months is delicious. We have mostly pebbly beaches and a sandy spot upstream near a big rock outcropping that we use for diving. The river is chilly until late June and it cools down again in late September. NEIGHBORS There are very few neighbors in this area. The Yurok village of Wautek is directly across the river from Otter Space. (Non-native name for Wautek is Johnsonâ\u0080\u0099s Bar, which used to be a trading post. Ships could get into the mouth of the Klamath and they would send boats upstream to trade with the Yurok for pelts and fish, etc. In the late 1800â\u0080\u0099s silt build up made it impossible for trading vessels to come into the river, so the trading dried up.) We also have a couple of neighbors who live on the property next to our meadow on the other side of our organic fruit orchard. Please use our pathways to travel property next to us, and respect the privacy and tranquility of our neighbors by not keeping late hours or playing loud music. COMMUNICATIONS We are in a remote area and do not have easy access to telecommunications systems. Regular cell phones do not work at Otter Space. This is not an inconvenience; itâ\u0080\u0099s an opportunity to notice how dependent we have become on our electronic connections! We suggest that you make arrangements to be entirely unreachable while you are in Otter Space, and see if the world can get by without your assistance.EMERGENCIES If someone needs to reach you in an emergency, they can call 913. 424. 8370. and leave a message. We will check messages at least once a day. This number is a special cel phone and outgoing calls will be made for emergencies only. If you need first aid beyond your own resources, please find Joe or Wendy, as they both have training in alternative medicines and will have some supplies or resources that could help. If you are in any way uncomfortable with their suggestions, please let them know and they will call for outside help without a second request. In extreme situations, we can call Humboldt CHP at 707. 268. 2000. They will dispatch the first available medevac helicopter, who will know which hospital is available; Mad River Hosp./Arcata - St. Joseph's Hosp./Eureka - Sutter Coast Hosp./Crescent City. Sutter Hospital can arrange a fixed wing airplane medevac from one of these sites to other facilities for treatment beyond what is offered locally. FOOD & WATER Please bring your own food, as the nearest market is an hour away in Orick. All the local people drink the local water, including Joe & Wendy and their kids and our other neighbors. Itâ\u0080\u0099s fine for bathing or cooking, but if you are at all nervous about drinking the water here, please pack in your own water for drinking. Please keep food and garbage out of the reach and smell of animals so we donâ\u0080\u0099t have animal visitors at night.GARBAGE", :lat=>41.3439, :lng=>-123.8662, :image_url=>"otter-space-blue-cottage"})

It houses a kitchen, dining hall, a living room, five bedrooms and three bathroom with a bathtub. It currently houses Agustin and Mea and their seven year old daughter Naia.Grateful to be voted #1 Campground on Hipcamp this year:  FIRST NATIONS PEOPLE OF THE ILLINOIS VALLEYFor thousands of years, the Takelma people lived in the Illinois and Rogue River valleys, what is now known as Josephine County. They lived in small bands close to the land. Interior southwest Oregon has pronounced seasons and the ancient Takelma adapted to these seasons by spending spring, summer and early fall months collecting and storing food for the winter season.  Salmon was central to their food source and way of life. The salmon diet was supplemented by game, such as deer, elk, beaver, bear, antelope and bighorn sheep. Smaller mammals, such as squirrels, rabbits and gophers, might have been snared by both men and women. They gathered the root of the Camas plant, part of the asparagus family, as well as acorns from the two native species of Oaks, the Oregon white oak and California black oak. Other vegetation included manzanita berries, pine nuts, tarweed seeds, wild plums and sunflowers. The Takelma are also known to have cultivated a native tobacco plant, but otherwise relied on the fruits of the wilderness for their survival. The main utensils included horn, bone and wood-made implements and a great variety of baskets constructed generally by twining on a hazel warp. Stone was used in the making of arrowheads and pestles. The clothing and personal adornment of the Takelma was similar to the tribes of northern California. Notable characteristics include facial painting, red-headed woodpecker scalps for men and basket caps for women. The women also tattooed the skin in three stripes and men tattooed the left arm.  European Settlement of the Illinois Valley began by the 1830â\u0080\u0099s, as the gold and logging industries developed. By the end of 1856, the traditional residents of the Rogue and Illinois River valleys were forcibly removed and relocated to the Siletz Reservation on the central Oregon coast. The Takelma were joined on the reservations by their neighbors, the Athapaskans and the Shasta, as well as tribes from even farther away, such as the Coos and Tillamook. It is reported that by 1906 less than ten Takelma were alive and able to speak their native language.In 1994, for the first time in over 140 years, an ancient ceremony took place to welcome home and give thanks for the returning salmon, on the Kanaka Flats of the Applegate River. People of all heritages were welcomed at the annual Salmon Gathering on the Applegate River until 2006. In 2007, the ceremony was moved to the place where it was held for thousands of years: the Tilomikh (Powerhouse Falls), on the Rogue River near Gold Hill, Oregon. Since then, the ceremony has taken place annually in its traditional location, demonstrating that the Takelma culture is alive and will continue into the future.  Today, Takelma descendents continue to reside on or near the Siletz and Grand Ronde reservations. The Pilgrims brought back the Salmon Ceremony to Southern Oregon. Due to the Pilgrimâ\u0080\u0099s contribution in returning the Salmon Ceremony to Jackson County, Agnis Baker-Pilgrim is known to some locals as the â\u0080\u0098Keeper of the Sacred Salmon Ceremony. Agnes, one of the oldest grandmothers of the International Council of the 13 Indigenous Grandmothers, has returned to the Rogue Valley and today her voice can be heard strong and clear, proving that the spirit and blood of her people are still with us.PLANT & ANIMAL RELATIONS  We are very fortunate to be surrounded by a widely diverse population of flora and fauna. As caretakers of this sacred land, we feel a strong responsibility to honor our plant and animal allies by not only protecting them and their habitat, but also to help educate others about what lives and grows here by providing people with opportunities to experience the beauty of these plants and animals for themselves. For this reason, We are honored to host the many different groups who will gather here on this land for learning and communing with the nature that flourishes here. We feel very fortunate to be involved in this process of helping promote a sustainable and abundant future for all living things on this planet by sharing knowledge and skills from the human past that can make a sustainable lifestyle a reality for everyone everywhere.The animals here include, but are not limited to deer, foxes, coyote, raccoon, skunks, and sometimes black bear though we havent seen any yet! The birds that surround us are migratory geese, quail, wild turkeys, hawks, ospreys and eagles. The fish that call the Illinois River their home are the Salmon People, Steelhead & Trout along with their friends the otter and ducks. The Land is a no-hunting zone so the animals here are abudant and safe.The plant life here is incredibly diverse. This land is home to many native grasses, ferns, and berries, wild flowers, as well as many other edible and medicinal plants and fungi such as mugwort, self-heal, soap root, and a variety of mushrooms. The tree population is a blend of hardwoods like Manzanita, Madrone, and several kinds of Oaks along with mature Fir, Pine, Cedar trees, Alder, Maple and Apples. With special attention to management of non-native and invasive plants, Spirit Weavers is committed to maintaining a well balanced forest ecosystem with high biodiversity.TIMES  Please clean up and check out of your site by 12:am on the day of your departure.

The Cabin sits on a high-fenced 84 acre wildlife refuge managed for Native Song Birds & Wild Turkey with walkable/bikeable trails.   \"Panther Creek\"  traverses the ranch & natural springs keep water in the ponds for wildlife.   Stars are extremely bright at this location  & the ranch is an  excellent spot for star gazing.   It is so quiet, most of the time you can hear the silence.    Two miniature donkeys visit guests around the cabin &  property to make sure you're safe, and you may see a couple of  fallow deer or whitetail.    The sounds of coyotes will call you  most evenings and nights, and it's not uncommon to hear foxes,  wild hogs and other wildlife throughout the night.   If you are a light sleeper, you may want to bring some ear plugs.   Bird seed & supplemental water are provided year round and make this a great destination for birders and outdoor enthusiasts.   Many unique bird species have been spotted on the ranch.    It is a 40 Minute drive to Kerrville or Fredericksburg, and about 30 minutes to Junction.   Area attractions include Enchanted Rock, the Eckert's James River Bat Cave, South Llano River State Park,  &  Texas Hill Country  wineries.   A couple of  Llano River crossings offer a nice place to cool off in the summer, or for putting in and out for kayak trips.

They occasionally have live music on their porch throughout the week, and regularly on Friday & Saturday nights scheduled until 9:30 pm.

There's no shower, bring a wash cloth and use your water to wipe down if you feel dusty and dirty after hiking all day.NOTE: SHOWERS are available at the nearby Red Canyon Campground on Highway 12, about a ten minute drive from my TIPI site. They are \"pay\" showers requiring coins (quarters), but the facilities are clean and well maintained and there are parking spaces near the shower building. The cost is $2.50 for eight minutes. The showers require quarters. There is a change machine on site that accepts $1 or $5 bills.4. There's no electricity onsite so, a portable battery charger for re-charging your phone is good to have. The solar powered camp light I provided does have one USB charging port, it works at night as long as it gets a good charge during the day.5.

If you plan to grill, there's a small charcoal grill which I provide but you need to bring charcoal, a long stem lighter, and starter fluid.7. If you want to burn a fire in the fire pit you'll need to buy fire wood (most stores here sell wood), bring some newspaper to get it started easily. The fire pit area is shared between guests so there could be some burning materials left behind but it's hard to say for sure.8. Bring a trash bag, you'll need to haul your trash out with you when you leave. Local garbage dumpsters are located 3 miles South just before the town of Hatch. Turn right onto the gravel road just after you see the power station and save animals billboard sign.There's an outhouse bathroom onsite, don't forget to bring a roll of toilet paper and hand sanitizer, or baby wipes. I provide those things as a backup in case you forget them or run out, but please don't rely on it, bring your own.# # #* There's no cleaning fee when you rent my TIPI because cleaning and tidying up is your responsibility before you leave.  * Be aware I'll be requesting the next guest staying after you informs me if the place was NOT left in good condition and the same goes for when you arrive, let me know if the previous guest did not leave things in good condition for you. If I don't hear from you then I'll assume everything was in good condition when you arrived.  ABOUT ME, YOUR HOST - I live in Hawaii most of the time however my Mom Jeannie and her husband David live on the adjacent lot, they will be your local hosts should any issue arise during your stay. I am always available to you via email, text, and phone.OTHER INFO: Hatch (4 miles South) and Panguitch (7 miles North) are the closet towns. Both offer great places to eat and some unique shopping stores. Panguitch has several places I like to eat at, C-Stop Pizza, Cowboys Smokehouse, and the Flying M has a great breakfast menu. Note many local businesses are closed on Sundays and many restaurants close before 9pm. Major retail stores like Walmart are in Cedar City about 1 hour away.Into fishing? About 7 miles South of my place along Hwy 89, Mammoth and Asay Creek are the head-water streams of the Sevier River. Asay Creek is designated as a Blue-Ribbon Stream, and Mammoth should be as well. Both streams have large fish populations and are easily accessed. There is over seven miles of public access on Mammoth Creek and several miles of access on Asay as well. Both streams are home to brown trout, with some rainbows in Asay, along with mountain white fish. Make sure you get a permit.I think that about covers it, let me know if any questions come to mind.

The nights allow for stellar star gazing that can't be seen from a crowded city. You'll find our site offers a true outdoor experience, while only a couple minutes from local restaurants and grocery stores. Strategically located in Hildale, the site provides access to several National and State Parks including Zion, Bryce and the Grand Canyon. We happily welcome couples, solo adventurers and friends.The site is set on 95 acres of wilderness, private property that sits at the base of the Canaan Mountains. It is easily accessible by any vehicle. Being 400 ft from the Maxwell Park entrance traffic can be heard since the park is visited frequently by vehicles and ATV's throughout the day and sometimes into the night.The site is equipped with a 10 X 12 ft. canvas tent that allows the guests to feel at home with nature, while enjoying the amenities that make it a comfortable experience. The queen bed is set up to accommodate two people, but we do allow you to bring a sleeping bag or blankets to use inside the tent on the wood platform to accommodate up to four people. The thick canvas tent is water and mildew treated, keeping you dry when it rains and keeping the temperature cooler in the summer and warmer in the winter. The front of the tent has a full screen door while the other 3 walls have screened windows, allowing great airflow while keeping bugs out. All of this is placed on a solid wood platform that keeps you out of the dirt and makes the tent very secure. A solar shower by heating the water with the Sun allows for a quick wash on extended stays. A small cabinet holds all of the utensils, dishes and a propane camping stove to prepare meals. A cooler is available for storing items and ice can be picked up locally. By visiting the nearby grocery store you're able to find the necessary ingredients for some great campfire food that can be enjoyed at the site. Nearby restaurants also provide a variety of local food options.We suggest that once you arrive, you take a moment to breathe and relax to enjoy the beauty of nature and enjoy the peace outside of the constant hustle of life. Sit in our Adirondack chairs on the front porch and watch the sunrise and sunset light up the surrounding mountains.The weather in this area is very desert based. During the summer it can be very warm, with comfortable night temperatures. The Spring and Fall seasons create perfect hiking weather - light jacket weather in the early morning, but very peaceful temperatures during the day. Sitting inside the tent with the front door open during a fall rain shower with a warm cup of cocoa and a book is one of our favorite experiences.Critters and bugs: You are outside of the city paved streets. There are some small animals such as squirrels and rabbits throughout the area. During the winter some deer occasionally make their way down through the valley. Spiders, ants, and black flies enjoy the area just as much as we do, but we have found the wood platform under the tent keeps you out of the dirt and with some bug spray, they're likely to not ruin your trip.Noises: During the day or night you can occasionally hear birds and other critters. The gravel road is about 400 ft away that leads to the nearby Maxwell Park. Cars and occasionally ATV's can be heard as people in the area enjoy visiting the park for picnics and retrieving water from the natural spring.From the site several trails are within walking distance including the Water Canyon Trail head known for its canyoneering and primitive trails. Above Water Canyon lies the Natural Bridge trail that travels across the mountain top making for a several hour hike. Near the Water Canyon Trail head is the start of the Squirrel Canyon Trail that travels along a creek bed for 1.5 miles before coming upon a natural amphitheater. While all those trails are considered primitive, for the more adventurous there is the El Capitan trail that travels several thousand feet up giving a vast view for miles.The site is very centralized for travel to several national parks including Zion (1 hr), Grand Canyon (2hr), Bryce Canyon(2hr) and several state parks including Snow Canyon, Quail Creek, Coral Pink Sand Dunes, Sand Hollow, Lake Powell, and Cedar Breaks. Mountain biking on Goosberry Mesa is also only 20 min away with several other bike trails.Guest accessClean public restrooms are located in the park right next to the property and are within walking distance.Potable water is also available in the park that comes from a natural spring up near the base of the mountains and is piped into the park.Interaction with guestsThe goal of establishing this glamping location is to allow guests the opportunity of solitude and privacy in an incredible part of the country. Due to this, the owner wonâ\u0080\u0099t be seen unless requested and can be contacted at any time.Other things to noteCell phone service is very limited with one bar at best. Guests have received a text at the location through AT&T, but it is not reliable. Service is more available one mile down the road. It is advised to download or print out any directions before traveling to the site.There are several places to eat in the town including a Bees Marketplace, (grocery store), Dollar General, Subway, Merry Wives Cafe and Berry Knoll Bakery.Traveling to the glamping site takes you through the town of Hildale. For those that do not already know, it is known for being the home of many FLDS members who dress in solid colored dresses.

Noises carry far...it's so quiet you can hear everything.    Frequently Asked QuestionsCan we have a fire?  The fire ban is law, not our rule.   We have a propane barbeque for cooking or you can bring your own propane-based items. The communal fire pit is not  being used right now, as it can get very warm at night (80+ degrees).  Are dogs allowed?Yes, as long as they are 100% non-aggressive and not barkers.  Pick up after your furry friends with waste bags! Be aware there are snakes in the area. If other campers are out, they must get along with other pups.Where are the nearest hiking trails?There is hiking right outside of the property! Also: Nogal Canyon Trail:  16 minutes.   Nogal Summit: 27 minutes.  Trail Head is about a 30 minute drive from the property. Upper Bonito Recreation area: 30 minutesWhere is the nearest beach?Twin Lakes State Beach, Waddell Beach, Seacliff State Beach.When are quiet hours?10p-8a. People live here for the peace. Please be mindful of your volume or unfortunately we will have to ask you to leave. You do not need to lock your vehicles here but if you do, please do not use lock/unlock functions that BEEP during quiet hours.    Is check-out time flexible?Yes, depending on the arrival time of the next guests.  Is check-in time flexible?Yes, but keep in mind itâ\u0080\u0099s very hot in the Summer until mid-afternoon. We highly recommend you check-in before dark. Many people who try to come late do not find us. The latest check-in time is TEN PM, because a) quiet hours start then and it is not fair to wake up our other guests and b) we have been working all day in the sun and are in bed around then.  WIFI?Nope! Reconnect with nature, disconnect from the grid.Cell service?Some/limited. Verizon and ATT are strong. TMobile spotty. Sprint is terrible. Just in general, but especially here.  Cooking?  A propane cooking stove is available for communal use by the main home.  There is a pot and pan and salt and pepper. You may also bring your own propane-based cooking apparatus.What kind of critters are around?Ringtail cats, bob cats and mountain lions (all rarely spotted), horny toads and other lizards,  rattlesnakes, flies, road runners and  lots of birds, crickets, butterflies, scorpions, wild mice. We have had very few sightings of the dangerous ones, but they do live in the area.  WeatherThis is a mountain micro-climate, which means it is unpredictable at times but in general during the summer months it is HOT from 10a-4p and you will want to adventure elsewhere, such as Ruidoso, before returning to your camp when it begins to cool off. Nights have been pleasantly warm (think Hawaii without the humidity). Unseasonably foggy days are possible and wind storms are possible, though rare. Though on the colder side, Fall and Winter are actually the most beautiful time of year here because of the EPIC sky colors and textures.Do you host events?Yes, we offer event and wedding services.

If you would like to pitch in and help with any projects just let us know. I was recently told of some fun ideas where campers can build their own campsite, that is totally doable here and we have a lumberyard where you can pull from to build your site.  I  love coffee, and when campers come and stay here I  love to have coffee and snacks available for breakfast, so if you want to join me for coffee in the morning just let me know.

I will meet you at the outside gate and teach you how to open and close it so that you can come and go as you please.

I  will give you a quick tour of the venue and show you where all the amenities are and I'll give you a map as well. Once the tour is done, the space is yours and my husband and my dog Sprout are around. I work from home so if you need anything just let me know.  We also have a neighbor dog named Blue, he is the friendliest pit but he may show up and say hello. If he bothers you, just contact me and I'll come get him.  We ask that all amplified music is turned down by 10pm and also all the lights in the venue will turn off by 10pm just for respect for the area.  We will leave the solar lights on over night so it won't be pitch black, unless you want them off, just let us know.   Music at your tent is totally fine and if you bring an instrument and feel like jamming, my husband and I both play guitar :)  The venue is near Lake Perris, Lake Elsinore, Skydive Perris, and Temecula wineries.

The Wild Rose Tipi is located at the base of the Sierra Nevada Mountains, just an hour from Lassen National Park, Lakes Basin, and over a million acres of National Forest.   The tipi is a short walk from several spring-fed swimming holes, and it overlooks the meadows and creeks of the 50-acre property. Simple but comfortable, the tipi is 20' in diameter and offers one full size bed (with bedding) with plenty of room for sleeping bags on the gravel floor. Outside the tipi is a picnic table and BBQ, and several additional shaded tent sites.   Additional bedding available upon request.  Nearby (and out of view)  is the host family's  small cabin (the tipi is their guest house), where campers are welcome to use the outdoor shower-- offering  an on-demand water heater and a view of the Sierra Nevada range. There is also a small treehouse where more adventurous guests are welcome to sleep.The Wild Rose  tipi is secluded, but not \"middle-of-nowhere-secluded.\" Usually, the loudest sounds are the geese, but campers may also hear the train, or sounds from the town of Greenville (two miles downstream).   There is also a shooting range about five miles away and some days you may hear noises from that.    Otherwise, there are quite a few hike-in meditation or yoga  bluffs where you will feel like a world away! The property borders over 500  acres of National Forest that you may also explore, and several secluded swimming holes.Your host family has enjoyed building lots of activities for their own children, which campers may use at their own risk- including a 50' zip line from a tree house and  a rock climbing wall.   Please note, we try to limit our impact on wild animals such as deer and rabbits,  so please keep your pups on a leash.  Activities in the area: Fishing or boating at nearby Lake Almanor, or Round Valley Lake, is always popular. We also highly recommend a visit to Mount Lassen National Park (one hour). Drakesbad hot springs is also top on the to-do list!If you have any questions about other nearby activities, feel free to reach out to us!  Otherwise, many of our campers enjoy the simple things- a lawn chair with a good book  in the creek, or watching the kids make little pots  out of the clay in the pond. Safety first, but we  always encourage adventure, playing in the mud, and free range children.  The Wild Rose  tipi may not have wifi, and we promise you will never be bored!FAQ's:  Are extra people ok, and is there a charge?   Yes that's fine. For pricing, please substitute 'tents' for 'people' in the additions as HipCamp does not have the option to add extra tents at this time. The cost is $10 per tent.   Any questions, just message me, we can work it out when you get here.Is there an extra cost for animals or vehicles? NopeHow far are the swimming holes from the tipi? About 1/4 mile walk.  How many people can the tipi sleep? Two in the bed and comfortably four on the floor.    Are large school groups permitted? For sure!  We have hosted up to 50! Just message us for group ideas. We can even offer guided tours of the property and use of the climbing wall.  How do I  store food? Storing food in  ice chests is fine, although preferred would be in your car. We do not offer bear boxes, but also have not had any reports of  critters or bears getting into food (yet). Bears here do not try and get into cars.  Do I  need to worry about bears in the tipi? Nope :)    If you have any fears, simply place the solar lamp in the door way, it will scare them. Bears here are frightened of people, lights, and noises.  Any other questions or concerns we are just a message away!  Thank you for your interest and we look forward to hosting you this summer.

For the more adventurous, we offer a full slate of self-guided recreational activities such as hiking, kayaking, fishing, ATVing, rock climbing, biking, natural water slides, stand up paddle boards and so much more. Do you enjoy bird watching?

If you come to stay with us at the weekend, you'll be welcome to join us around the campfire and connect with fellow campers (we have fires on most Saturdays, s'mores are on us!)Did we mention that we love dogs? Be sure to bring you four legged friend when staying with us (we can accommodate up to two dogs at each site). With dog wash and off-leash dog beach, your adventure pup will be a happy camper here!

It faces an open valley with stunning views of Mount Holy Cross and the surrounding mountains. In the summer, visitors can access miles of hiking trails in wilderness frequented by elk, hawks, bears, moose, deer, and coyotes. In the winter, skiers can access terrain ranging from steep bowls that challenge seasoned skiers to mild slopes that invite beginners.The hut is suitable for diverse groups of users with varying backcountry experience. During much of the summer, guests can drive, hike, or bike to the hut from either Lake or Park county.

It is more suited for large groups with several tents  or RV's or larger camper trailers with a pull through parking area.  Site 1 - There is a four burner gas grill with side stovetop and gas fire pit. There is also a large  picnic table. Bring you own 25 lb  gas bottle.   It has a drive through driveway through an ancient Bristlecone Pine forest  for trailers up to 24 ft. and enough space for several tents.   It is well   tucked into the trees for shade and wind break. If your trailer is too long, there is space among the forest edge to park.Site 2 - Rock outcrops, fantastic views of the Continental Divide through Aspen and pine forest and leveled tent spaces for 3 tents. You are sheltered from the wind, but not quite as much as Site 1.  A camper trailer would have to park in the parking area and be able to back in or out with a 4WD vehicle. There is a gas fire pit and a gas grill. Bring your own propane tank.  Also, there is a table and chairs and a fire ring. This was our first permanent camp spot. Our teepee was set up here for years above the stone fire pit, as the place we would love to build.  To describe my camping there June 5, 2018. I arrived with my packing goats and set them out to forage. I set up camp and had a couple of beers before the late evening twilight. I was watching the sun fade on the snow covered peaks in the distance. Had dinner and watched the intense stars overhead after dark. The SILENCE is DEAFENING! No cars, no planes, no air conditioner hum, no human generated sound. In the morning the songbirds wake you up. Later the wind begins to whisper through the trees. Later the trees are wavering overhead and you know it is howling over the surrounding plains. But it is relatively still in the woods. That is why the campsites are buried in the trees. Before I left the next day, I walked through the aspens mixed with Bristlecone Pine and marveled at the wildflowers that cover the ground with a carpet of tenacious plants. They have a fleeting moment of beauty and continue through the year, conserving the precious water they get mostly as snow in winter. I pass a couple antelope on the driveway going out. Down the hill, the neighbor's horses are galloping across the grassland away from my noisy truck. South Park........give the other drivers a little wave from the steering wheel as you drive by. They still like to know there are neighbors around.  ", :lat=>39.17055, :lng=>-105.74025, :image_url=>"south-park-forest-and-plains"})

Having a toilet a short walk away was a huge plus. Mark was the best host we could ask for. He was extremely polite and helpful, he brought us an axe upon asking for one and even left out some wood for us and helped us to the site. The beautiful untouched land is amazing and the site is big enough for a nice walk by the small waterfall and big cliff, well worth a visit here. Already planning on coming back for the fall foliage because of how great our experience was. If you want an extremely quiet and secluded campground away from big crowds and small sites, come here.\"AT YOUR CAMPSITE     A lot of thought went into designing the sites for solitude, fun and privacy. Every camper has told us they loved the genuine camping experience. The 7 tent sites are spread over many acres, in our beautiful coastal forest, only three miles to the ocean. You can hear the surf many nights. Each tent site is unique, with views, stream, fire pits, peacefulness, cliffs, mossy boulders,  wildlife and more. For your comfort, we have spread a thick layer of soft pine needles over each tent area, which makes  for an incredibly relaxing, comfortable sleep. All sites have marked trees to hang hammocks from for added enjoyment. At WildWalkWays, you are in the real Maine woods with trees, deer and nature all around you but you are not isolated. Rest assured, there are no poisonous snakes or crocodiles!  You will wake to the  fresh  scents of the pine forest and aromatic bayberry in the air. I know that might sound corny but it's true.  CREATURE COMFORTS     There are quality, enclosed portable toilets a short walk from every  site, with soft lighting near each one so you can find your way. They are cleaned and supplied daily.

HERE IS ONE   REVIEW RANDOMLY PULLED BELOW\"I had the best camping experience Iâ\u0080\u0099ve ever had at the Cedar Meadows campsite, it was completely pushed into the woods and it was the biggest campsite too, we hung our hammock up and listened to birds chirping, you canâ\u0080\u0099t hear anything but wildlife. Having a toilet a short walk away was a huge plus. Mark was the best host we could ask for. He was extremely polite and helpful, he brought us an axe upon asking for one and even left out some wood for us and helped us to the site. The beautiful untouched land is amazing and the site is big enough for a nice walk by the small waterfall and big cliff, well worth a visit here. Already planning on coming back for the fall foliage because of how great our experience was. If you want an extremely quiet and secluded campground away from big crowds and small sites, come here.\"AT YOUR CAMPSITE     A lot of thought went into designing the sites for solitude, fun and privacy. Every camper has told us they loved the genuine camping experience. The 7 tent sites are spread over many acres, in our beautiful coastal forest, only three miles to the ocean. You can hear the surf many nights. Each tent site is unique, with views, stream, fire pits, peacefulness, cliffs, mossy boulders,  wildlife and more. For your comfort, we have spread a thick layer of soft pine needles over each tent area, which makes  for an incredibly relaxing, comfortable sleep. All sites have marked trees to hang hammocks from for added enjoyment. At WildWalkWays, you are in the real Maine woods with trees, deer and nature all around you but you are not isolated. Rest assured, there are no poisonous snakes or crocodiles!  You will wake to the  fresh  scents of the pine forest and aromatic bayberry in the air. I know that might sound corny but it's true.  CREATURE COMFORTS     There are quality, enclosed portable toilets a short walk from every  site, with soft lighting near each one so you can find your way. They are cleaned and supplied daily.

They lived in small bands close to the land. Interior southwest Oregon has pronounced seasons and the ancient Takelma adapted to these seasons by spending spring, summer and early fall months collecting and storing food for the winter season. Salmon was central to their food source and way of life. The salmon diet was supplemented by game, such as deer, elk, beaver, bear, antelope and bighorn sheep. Smaller mammals, such as squirrels, rabbits and gophers, might have been snared by both men and women. They gathered the root of the Camas plant, part of the asparagus family, as well as acorns from the two native species of Oaks, the Oregon white oak and California black oak. Other vegetation included manzanita berries, pine nuts, tarweed seeds, wild plums and sunflowers. The Takelma are also known to have cultivated a native tobacco plant, but otherwise relied on the fruits of the wilderness for their survival. The main utensils included horn, bone and wood-made implements and a great variety of baskets constructed generally by twining on a hazel warp. Stone was used in the making of arrowheads and pestles. The clothing and personal adornment of the Takelma was similar to the tribes of northern California. Notable characteristics include facial painting, red-headed woodpecker scalps for men and basket caps for women. The women also tattooed the skin in three stripes and men tattooed the left arm. European Settlement of the Illinois Valley began by the 1830â\u0080\u0099s, as the gold and logging industries developed. By the end of 1856, the traditional residents of the Rogue and Illinois River valleys were forcibly removed and relocated to the Siletz Reservation on the central Oregon coast. The Takelma were joined on the reservations by their neighbors, the Athapaskans and the Shasta, as well as tribes from even farther away, such as the Coos and Tillamook. It is reported that by 1906 less than ten Takelma were alive and able to speak their native language.In 1994, for the first time in over 140 years, an ancient ceremony took place to welcome home and give thanks for the returning salmon, on the Kanaka Flats of the Applegate River. People of all heritages were welcomed at the annual Salmon Gathering on the Applegate River until 2006. In 2007, the ceremony was moved to the place where it was held for thousands of years: the Tilomikh (Powerhouse Falls), on the Rogue River near Gold Hill, Oregon. Since then, the ceremony has taken place annually in its traditional location, demonstrating that the Takelma culture is alive and will continue into the future. Today, Takelma descendents continue to reside on or near the Siletz and Grand Ronde reservations.

As caretakers of this sacred land, we feel a strong responsibility to honor our plant and animal allies by not only protecting them and their habitat, but also to help educate others about what lives and grows here by providing people with opportunities to experience the beauty of these plants and animals for themselves. For this reason, We are honored to host the many different groups who will gather here on this land for learning and communing with the nature that flourishes here. We feel very fortunate to be involved in this process of helping promote a sustainable and abundant future for all living things on this planet by sharing knowledge and skills from the human past that can make a sustainable lifestyle a reality for everyone everywhere.The animals here include, but are not limited to deer, foxes, coyote, raccoon, skunks, and sometimes black bear though we havent seen any yet! The birds that surround us are migratory geese, quail, wild turkeys, hawks, ospreys and eagles. The fish that call the Illinois River their home are the Salmon People, Steelhead & Trout along with their friends the otter and ducks. The Land is a no-hunting zone so the animals here are abudant and safe.The plant life here is incredibly diverse. This land is home to many native grasses, ferns, and berries, wild flowers, as well as many other edible and medicinal plants and fungi such as mugwort, self-heal, soap root, and a variety of mushrooms.

Grateful to be voted #1 Campground on Hipcamp this year!FIRST NATIONS PEOPLE OF THE ILLINOIS VALLEYFor thousands of years, the Takelma people lived in the Illinois and Rogue River valleys, what is now known as Josephine County. They lived in small bands close to the land. Interior southwest Oregon has pronounced seasons and the ancient Takelma adapted to these seasons by spending spring, summer and early fall months collecting and storing food for the winter season. Salmon was central to their food source and way of life. The salmon diet was supplemented by game, such as deer, elk, beaver, bear, antelope and bighorn sheep. Smaller mammals, such as squirrels, rabbits and gophers, might have been snared by both men and women. They gathered the root of the Camas plant, part of the asparagus family, as well as acorns from the two native species of Oaks, the Oregon white oak and California black oak. Other vegetation included manzanita berries, pine nuts, tarweed seeds, wild plums and sunflowers. The Takelma are also known to have cultivated a native tobacco plant, but otherwise relied on the fruits of the wilderness for their survival. The main utensils included horn, bone and wood-made implements and a great variety of baskets constructed generally by twining on a hazel warp. Stone was used in the making of arrowheads and pestles. The clothing and personal adornment of the Takelma was similar to the tribes of northern California. Notable characteristics include facial painting, red-headed woodpecker scalps for men and basket caps for women. The women also tattooed the skin in three stripes and men tattooed the left arm. European Settlement of the Illinois Valley began by the 1830â\u0080\u0099s, as the gold and logging industries developed. By the end of 1856, the traditional residents of the Rogue and Illinois River valleys were forcibly removed and relocated to the Siletz Reservation on the central Oregon coast. The Takelma were joined on the reservations by their neighbors, the Athapaskans and the Shasta, as well as tribes from even farther away, such as the Coos and Tillamook. It is reported that by 1906 less than ten Takelma were alive and able to speak their native language.In 1994, for the first time in over 140 years, an ancient ceremony took place to welcome home and give thanks for the returning salmon, on the Kanaka Flats of the Applegate River. People of all heritages were welcomed at the annual Salmon Gathering on the Applegate River until 2006. In 2007, the ceremony was moved to the place where it was held for thousands of years: the Tilomikh (Powerhouse Falls), on the Rogue River near Gold Hill, Oregon. Since then, the ceremony has taken place annually in its traditional location, demonstrating that the Takelma culture is alive and will continue into the future.  Today, Takelma descendents continue to reside on or near the Siletz and Grand Ronde reservations. The Pilgrims brought back the Salmon Ceremony to Southern Oregon. Due to the Pilgrimâ\u0080\u0099s contribution in returning the Salmon Ceremony to Jackson County, Agnis Baker-Pilgrim is known to some locals as the â\u0080\u0098Keeper of the Sacred Salmon Ceremony.  Agnes, one of the oldest grandmothers of the International Council of the 13 Indigenous Grandmothers, has returned to the Rogue Valley and today her voice can be heard strong and clear, proving that the spirit and blood of her people are still with us.PLANT & ANIMAL RELATIONS We are very fortunate to be surrounded by a widely diverse population of flora and fauna.

Now completed, I feel inspired to share their solitude and beauty with others who will appreciate it. From the top of a steep drive, a brief but precipitous hike leads you high up very quickly through a mature forest to some steps that lead the first of two camping locations leveled within clefts of rocks forming a pair of overlooks.  A  soft,  level campsite awaits you there under a canopy of trees  where you will find everything you'll need for a small-scale forest outing.        The lower level either  stands alone (1-2 persons)  or  serves as a base  camp for the Northwest Expansion  area (3-5 persons)  a very  short hike away.  The expansion  features a roomy 13 x 15ft groomed tenting surface, a stone fire ring  with steel fire pit,  and plenty of extra  space to spread out.   It provides an additional layer of  privacy and a (leaf-permitting) northwest view that usually includes a sunset.        [Note: A booking of 3 or more  campers reserves both the original lower level and  the upper  Northwest Expansion camping areas.   Keep in mind that  the technical nature of the trail to reach the upper level may make it unsuitable for children not experienced  with hiking/camping.   Under 7 years old not recommended.]        Hundreds of feet away, there are a few homes residing below the camps,  but you are high enough above the world  below to enjoy a sense of separation from it.    Were  these  camping areas  part of any state or  commercial campground  in Pennsylvania they would easily be  among the best tenting sites in  the state.   Even among Hipcamps we were awarded a  top-ten rating in  2018-and  we've improved since then. People  love it here.         Overnight guests  will find a  huge, fully-stocked chest of supplies  at the lower level to furnish virtually  everything you might need to camp in comfort,  from pots and pans to cushions, an air pump,  and repellent to  lighting and phone chargers.  (There's even a Scrabble game and playing cards.)  We took every item on your camping list and tried to supply it for you so you can visit more spontaneously and not have to stock up on everything in advance.        We  provide a two-person hammock,  some firewood,  a bag of charcoal, and plenty of  spring  water-none of which will you have to carry up.  A dry bag with a fire starting kit is included  if you aren't keen on starting from scratch. Extra firewood can easily be gathered or purchased. There are hatchets and saws in the  supply box for cutting  fallen branches down to size, and bundles of  dry  firewood are available at the trailhead (which can be paid for in  advance or as needed during your stay.) There is even  a dual burner propane camp stove provided  if that's your thing.    We tried to think of everything  so you wouldn't have to, just bring your tent, bedding, and food up and we'll supply almost everything else.          Daytime and evening hours are available too for morning bird walks, lunch breaks, herbal retreats, sunset cookouts--whatever guests might imagine doing in the privacy of the outdoors.  The woods are teeming with  resident species of woodpeckers, owls, warblers and more, and vultures and  hawks and  can almost always be seen riding thermals overhead. If you're lucky the turkeys will come to roost in the woods above the area as they often do. The best part is that  no one else will know you are up  there.

There is also a nearby private pond (Moby Dick's Private Pond) for catch and release fishing, and if you have a fishing license you can hike into the park with your pole and fish from several places along the banks.

Situated on 20 acres and surrounded by tall pines and aspens, Argyle Aframe is the perfect escape from the noise and chaos of everyday life.   Summer activities on the property include archery, splitting wood, hiking, horse shoes or just cozying up inside and reading a book by the wood-burning stove!   We also supply some board games and books for evenings inside.   In the winter months, there is great skiing and snowboarding around the cabin as well.Life at the cabin is simple, but that means you'll go without basic, modern luxuries like running water, plumbing and electricity.   The bathroom is an outhouse and the main water source is a 7-gallon pressurized sprayer that can be filled at a local (seasonal) spring!   For doing dishes or even the occasional shower, it gets the job done and adds to the off-grid experience.   Light is provided by a basic LED solar kit as well as battery and gas powered lanterns.    The cabin has four beds (two on the main level and two in the loft) and can sleep 8.    Cooking can all be done on a gas stove and small oven, so you can make a lot of the meals you would at home.   The wood-burning stove presents some opportunities for cooking if you're up for the challenge!   We supply all of the dishes, utensils and accessories you'd need, including cast iron pans and a 12-cup percolator (cabins and coffee go hand in hand).Cell phone service is hit or miss.   AT&T does pretty well, with Verizon being spotty.   However, we recommend taking time to disconnect from technology and enjoy the sights, sounds and smells of the forest.    Being so remote, there is nothing in the area other than some other cabins and mother nature.   The nearest gas station, restaurant or bar is over 30 minutes away, so come prepared with everything you'd need for a weekend in the woods!   This includes a good cooler and plenty of ice to keep your food (ahem, cocktails) cold!Access in the winter is done by snowmobile, snowshoe or skis.   It's a moderate 3.2 mile trek from the parking area on a (usually) packed snow road.   In the winter, water can be obtained by melting snow in the supplied pots on the wood-burning stove!We LOVE the time we spend at the cabin and know you will too!

It overlooks the fire pit and playground and is a fun place to play.  The fenced yard is large and there are several gardens, greenhouse, and flower gardens to enjoy. Well behaved people-friendly pets are always welcome.   We have chickens so if your dog might bother them we'll just close the gate for the chickens so that they are protected in their own yard.  Fresh eggs and seasonal vegetables and herbs are free for our visitors. There are fruit trees in the area and plenty of places to access other fresh goods like cheese, honey, yogurt and milk products from organic farms. The closest grocery store is 17 minutes away so we recommend you purchase groceries before you come here to camp. There is a gas station five miles away and they sell some overpriced emergency food and have a small deli for sandwiches. We can share some refrigerator space if you don't have a cooler.  Our playground has a trampoline, swing, slide, sandbox, hobbit hut fort, and of course our art bus which is fun to play in for kids. There's a lawn area as well as cement patio for chalk drawing or games, and we have plenty of tables that can be set up or arranged for meals or parties.

BYO charcoal to be safe.-Propane Fire: we recently added a semi-portable patio propane fire-ring if families/kids want to do smores in the dry summer.

(this is probably the safest compromise:)-POWER: there is an outside GFI outlet with plastic cover @on side of barn as well as near the RV power stand that can be shared. Extension cords can be left on sight if that helps your kiddos feel safer at night for tent light or a laptop movie etc. (yes, the point is to camp, but whatever gets the kids outside is fine by us!)-BBQ: Shared grill found near barn or RV pad,   2 metal fire pits, are open to all.-KALE, Peas, and SALAD greens  are growing again near the house!

Almost all campers could be in view of the house, shop and barn.   This is a very open spot with brush, tall canary  grasses and wheat fields with grand nightly  stargazing views and no neighbors looking onto the property.

Or for parents that just want to get their kids out and spend a night or two \"practicing\" tent set up and camp cooking.

We have the perfect balance of privacy, proximity to attractions, and year round easy access right on Scenic Hwy 9 between Black Mountain and Chimney Rock/Lake Lure. Family friendly with an instant playmate for your kids, my super social son Tender Wolf! Before I was able to secure stewardship of (buy) this beautiful healing slice of heaven i was traveling annually to WNC for a necessary nature plunge.  I needed the incredible green of the forest teeming with diversity to heal my heart, the  purity of the crystal clear cold water to cleanse my spirit, the expansive views of the mountains which somehow helps with reshaping perspective, and to see the real dark sky with no light pollution, only stars to inspire my dreams.  I'm ever so grateful and thankful to have this as my and my childs' daily life now and I'm happy to share the deep peace and comfort we've found with you and your family.Ways to Enjoy Your Stay  We love hiking daily both on land or in the creek. There are a couple of swimming holes and waterfalls along the creek perfect for hiding from the midday 'heat' (i'm from Fl soooo that word doesn't describe what i feel, lol, it feels like airconditioning to me all day outside! lol). While Asheville has been seeing temps in the mid 90's we haven't hit above 85 in the field and it stays a cool lovely 70 by the creek and the water is much colder than that.  You can definitely spend a full day just enjoying the property and a week or better checking out all the other sites in the area without spending too much time in the car and without wasting time changing camp locations. Sooooo many options are available within 25 minutes and even those farther away points of usual interest  are around an hour (your in the forests the whole time along the way)On property, both hikes are easy to moderate in difficulty. The land hike has a shorter and a longer option, the longer one takes you to the top of the ridge-line and there are some large rock out croppings on the way. Views are lovely year round but the summer foliage does reduce them some. The land hike is easier and certainly dryer than the creek, haha. The Creek hike is my favorite though. It is a bit more difficult than the land hike and you will have to get wet as well as either go on land or go through possibly hip deep water to make it whole way. I often wear rain boots or water shoes to protect my feet since i go between the water and the land. You'll see small waterfalls, really cool natural rock formations, remnants of stoned logging road, small swimming holes, downed trees to climb over under or around, snails, salamanders, and crayfish. Please be careful were you step and do not move around the stones where they have their beds. They are all signs of beautifully clean pristine top of the watershed healthy creek and i am honored to steward it's continued health.  If you need an even easier day just relax by the creek let the kids play on the trampoline, the tether ball, soccer, and the close part of the creek.   Soak up some sun doing Yoga or Qigong in the field and in the evening hang by the camp fire. Enjoy the rarity of 0 light pollution by gazing at the star studded sky and be mesmerized by the silent fireworks show provided nightly by the billions of fireflys.   Rain or shine,  Guests are welcome to hang in the screened and covered patio, by the fire, or in the lounge/kitchen (garage).  If you feel like lending a hand i'll gladly make use of your skills and or for highly skilled grading, gardening, carpentry,  or plumbing maybe able to consider a trade or better.Lodging  Campsites are available on the cleared future Earthship home site   and below the homesite at the top of the field 10-20 tents can easily be accommodated in these area and a porta-potty will be   located here. There is also plenty of room for an additional 5+ tents on the levelish ' backyard' area between the barn and the house, patio, lounge areaThe above are the known level areas of the property, if you find a different spot that you like you are welcome to pitch your tent there. While i have a pretty large capacity for total camping for retreat options, i will limit the number of different groups to what seems comfortable for all.    I am open to hostessing and have a background in helping facilitate and cook for retreats, reunions, and events. Please connect with me r your details and we'll make it magical!

But it's only enough to know the zombie apocalypse has yet to begin, lol, and is super minimal at night.   Drinking Water, Toilets, and ShoweringDrinking water is available at the hose on the lower part of the property all the time and in the house (additionally filtered) during the same hours showers and kitchen use is. Even from the hose It's clean delicious mountain well water. There is also a popular filling spot on hwy 9 that is from a piped spring and free for all to enjoy. You will want to have containers to hold water you may need at the campsite but you can fill as needed on property. A porta-potty is available at the tent site and showers are available in my home during certain hours, the creek is fantastic for rinsing off (no soap) anytime.

Feel yourselves relax and rejuvenate as you drive up our  winding driveway surrounded by private woods and  national forest.   Designed by local artist Deborah White, this off grid microcabin treehouse is a whimsical mix of art and architecture. Anchored to two trees and two posts, the treehouse sits about 3 feet off the ground.  Enjoy the forest and mountain views through 4 windows each with custom shutters.  Inside your luxury microcabin is a comfy cozy coccoon with a pillow top memory foam queen bed, mountain fresh linens and mounds of pillows to sink into and drift off to an amazing deep sleep.  This is a completely off grid glamping site.   There is a propane heater in the tree cabin to keep it even cozier in cool or cold weather; however the camp toilet is in a covered enclosure outside.  ***If you have any difficulty booking, please message me and I will respond immediately.  We have had several guests report trouble booking and we were able to get it resolved right away.***(  It is an amazing unforgettable winter glamping experience for those who are looking for and prepared for that experience.)Just outside the custom canvas and wood door of your treehouse, you can sink into your plush armchairs with a glass of wine and enjoy the sights, sounds and smells of the evening forest; relax in the screened pergola in your loveseat and chair; or prepare a gourmet meal (or delicious burgers) on your camp chef camp stove with two burners and a fully functional oven (for roasting veggies, baking breads, muffins or even cakes!).

The construction crew makes a mess sometimes, so be forewarned. They may be working inside the dome when you are here, but the property will not be available when active construction is going on outside.  Also, to be clear, this is glamping and not high on the luxury scale. There are wild animals and mice that we cannot control, including a very active bear or two. The cabin is cleaned after every guest, and we do a walk-through before the next guest within 24-48 hours of arrival. If you find evidence that a mouse has been there since our walk-through, call and we will address the problem if you want. If you see trash, let us know immediately to prevent bears from getting to it.  Some things are out of our control. We want you to be happy and part of that entails clear expectations;-)  This studio overlooking Pike National Forest is glass on all sides and surrounded by glorious mountains and skies that go on forever - perfect for Glamping!  The small cabin is suitable for 2 adults. One queen air bed is provided and a queen size futon.   NOTE: If you have back problems, this may not be a comfortable bed for you.There is an outdoor kitchen with gas grill and cooktop. A cooler is available on site.

The South Platte runs just below the cabin. You can't see the water, but the sound is mesmerizing. Skilled hikers can hike down from the cabin to the river and follow it in either direction. The forest is across the river, but there is not bridge.HOUSE MANUALSanctuary in the Sky (SIS) is a project sponsored by Colorado Companion Animal Sanctuary to generate income for the nonprofit cat sanctuary that is on site.  Guests may visit the cat sanctuary during your stay. If you are interested, let us know and we will plan a visit. There are only 10 cats on site and all have special needs.FOR THOSE UNFAMILIAR WITH MOUNTAIN LIFEThe sun here is really hot - use sunscreen and appropriate clothing. Sunglasses are also helpful, even in the winter. It gets cold at night, so layering your clothes is recommended.The cabin is all light, all the time. It gets hot really quickly in the morning. Keep windows cracked only an inch or so at night to allow some airflow but prevent problems with wildlife.  During the day, you can keep windows open while you are there, but close except an inch or so when away.  The wind can become very strong at times. Be careful not to leave things on the deck or outside.Deer are all around and often near or on the road, especially early morning and late afternoon. Drive carefully and be prepared to stop and wait if necessary. People often flash their headlights to signal deer ahead.  Donâ\u0080\u0099t feed or pet them, please. If you find a fawn, just leave it there - mom is usually nearby looking for food.Also, we often have afternoon thunderstorms, sometimes with hail. They are usually pretty brief, but can be extreme and wash out dirt and gravel roads or hillsides.  Be very careful when driving on the these roads after a storm in case of a landslide - same for walking the path to the cabin.The higher elevation may cause symptoms of altitude sickness. These include headache, extreme fatigue/sleepiness, nausea and dizziness.  You can buy small canisters of oxygen at convenience stores to use as needed. Drinking Gatorade and water helps prevent or relieve symptoms.You will see evidence of a fire and clean-up as you arrive at the cabin. Please avoid those areas and excuse our mess. We will be rebuilding in summer 2019, hopefully.HOUSE RULES AND INFORMATIONThe cabin was just remodeled and we would like your help to keep it in good condition.

The canyon opens out to be a small valley bordered by the Sangre de Cristo Mountains peaking at over 13,000 feet  to the immediate south, the wild Arkansas River, then cliffs and smaller mountains to the north.   Nestled in the Valley is the village of Coaldale, established in 1878.  The Coaldale Post Office is at the east end of Itty Bitty Lakes. Itty Bitty Lakes was a state fish hatchery in the 1930s. The formal campground with full hook-ups was added some 70 years ago. Down on the river, some of the old raceways are now wetland habitats filled with wildflowers and small birds all summer. Besides these wetlands are several more primitive camping sites along the river. Huge 70-year-old Mountain Elms and Peach Leaf Willows shade the entire property. Rocky Mountain Junipers are scattered throughout.  In the center of the property is the Juniper Art Gallery. This is also the campground office. The owners, Robert and Kay Parker, are artists. The building also houses painting, sculpture and weaving studios, as well as the Parker home.   On the west side of the property are two old ponds with massive Peach Leaf Willows hanging over the banks. This property is great for group camping and for small intimate campsites close to and above  the river.  Near the center and at the entrance to the formal campground is the shower house bathrooms .

The six Swings and the Treehouse are open for all campers to share, kids and adults. Select our new Glamping Site 1 if you want to reserve the Jayco Popup Camper that we have permanently setup on the bank of McFadden Bayou. Big screened windows all around. Bring your pillows, sleeping bags or sheets. Great if you don't have a tent... (plus you also have plenty of flat gound if you also want to setup your own tents for the kids). The Camper has a King bed, a Double bed, and three single beds. It also has two propane cook stoves, one inside and one outside. And a sink with water. You have a fire ring, picnic table and close-up parking for 4 vehicles.Select Site #2 if you want to reserve the big 12 by 16 foot Roof Deck with hammock, table and chairs and room for your tent to be up off the ground. And/Or you can can setup your tents under the Champion Live Oak trees, or under the stars. You have your own fire ring and picnic table. If you have no tents, we can rent them to you and we will set them up before you arrive.Select Site #3 or Site #4 if you want to bring your own RV, van, motorhome or trailer. Lots of room to park. Also lots of spots to set up tents. You have your own fire ring and picnic table. You can make a big campfire in your fire ring or boil that big bag of crawfish.The six Swings and the Treehouse are open for all campers to share, kids and adults. Swing high and sip your favorite beverage under the biggest three Live Oak trees in Texas. It is really different flying on a 40 foot tall swing! Kids yell with delight when you give them the big push and they get a thrill they never felt before.Surfside Beach is only 17 miles away with two Bucees on the way for all your supplies.   We provide free firwood.... please don't bring any because it might have the Oak Tree Blight fungus. There is no water or electricity available at the property... it is truly off-the-grid. Along with your tents, bring your own drinking and washing water. (We can sell you 5 gallon jugs if you run out.)   A pair of commercial Porta-Can toilets is near the entrance road. There are houses across the county road from the property , but, from your camp, you can't see anything but trees and rainforest jungle. You are in the middle of five acres of forest and grassy fields.  The west border is McFadden Bayou where the antebellum farmers transported cotton and sugar cane to market. You can fish there with no license. But it's only a 12 minute drive to the Brazos Mall, Walmart, and all the restaurants. Only 30 minutes to the beaches and deep sea fishing charters. Three champion Live Oak Trees dominate the site of the largest settlement in the original Stephen F. Austin land grant. The largest Live Oak is 22 feet around, has a 120 foot branch span (as wide as two city lots) , and is 840 years old. The tallest is 87 feet to the top leaf. Sadly, in September 2019 Tropical Storm Imelda rained so hard that one of our giant Live Oak trees fell over from the weight of the rainfall on its one huge horizontal branch. This is the biggest fallen tree you ever did see. The root ball at the base of the tree is 16 feet tall and you need a 12 foot ladder to get on top of the horizontal trunk. We are designing a tree house to sit on that majestic piece of wood since it is too big to cut with a chainsaw and will last at least 30 more years.Hike around the 5 acre property... crawl inside a 'hobbit house' hollow pecan tree... eat a tangerine from a wild tangerine tree (fruit December - February)... see the passion fruit vines, blackberries and dewberries (springtime), and monster muscadine grape vines hanging 50 feet high. Take the Cypress Trail down to the shore of historic McFadden Bayou   to see a beautiful tall cypress tree with hundreds of knee roots sticking up.

If you decide to explore in the other direction, Metro's Gold Line (in 1 stop) will take you to the heart of Highland Park's bustling scene -  offering a smorgasbord of eateries, coffee-shops,  speakeasies, boutiques, yoga studios and art galleries - including LA's oldest bowling alley: Highland Park Bowl. Take the train further and you're in the heart of glorious Pasadena (home to The Rose Bowl and exceptional Norton Simon Museum)-- or continue out to beautiful Sierra Madre -- where there is hiking and exploring galore! At La Boheme you can grill onsite, order take-out, dine out, stay-in and book a personal masseuse (that will change your world!) You can find places to hike, bike, play tennis, come back and shower (with hot water) - enjoy some bubbly with your honey on the deck -- take the train downtown to catch a concert at the Staples center -- Uber back - light the chiminea -- roast a s'more or two and crawl into your super comfy REAL bed in your REAL Safari Tent!  Remember -- this is URBAN Glamping -- a friendly reminder that there can be normal city noises throughout your stay -- like a Fire Engine answering a call - or the train running behind the property -- or a kid crying in the apartment next door.

Roosters have no respect for quiet time. If this bothers you, bring ear plugs. We also sell good quality wax ear plugs for $2/pair) Our Nigerian Dwarf Goats will beg for treats and attention.

We limit the number of campers and sites so you can enjoy the property with peace and solitude. There are only 5 camp sites on 11 acres so that you can spread out and enjoy the peace without being over crowded.We have a solar shower! The temperature of the water depends on how much sun we get that day so early morning showers will be cold! Check the temperature of the water before stepping under because it can get very hot or cold! Also realize the hot water is limited and it will take a couple hours before it will heat up again between showers. Showers will only be warm for 5-10 minutes.If you bring friends, make sure you give them the link to the listing so they know what to expect! This isn't glamping and if you sell it to them like it is then they will be disappointed, you will have a bad trip when they whine about it and it's not fair to us if they leave a bad review because they expected glamping when we are very straight forward about the amenities and what we offer. ESPECIALLY tell them about the compost toilet. Please. True campers leave no trace behind. Clean up after yourselves and be respectful of our home. Only bring guests who can do the same.DESCRIPTION OF EACH SITE:There are pros-cons to each site and it depends what you are looking for while camping. There are no tables/chairs at the sites. Tables/chairs are provided in the common areas. There is no shade at any site thought there is plenty in the common area with hammocks and misters to cool off.

It is not close to the shower/bathroom.Site 3 offers a great view of the sunset and is on the West side of the property. It is very close to the shower/bathrooms. HOWEVER it is behind the chicken coop. This means it is very private but if you choose this site bring ear plugs or buy them from us. You may also smell the goats as the male goat pen is here as well. The Roosters start crowing about 3am. If this bothers you don't book this site. You can drive to this site. There is no shade.  Site 4 is the most popular site. It is on top of a hill in the middle of the property and has an amazing view of the valley. It is level enough to accommodate trailers/RVS but there are no hookups here. It is easy to drive to. It is not close to the bathroom/shower but it isn't super far either. There is no shade.

They are located separate areas, sit on grass and have a  more wooded surrounding.

The farm's cabin has been spiffed up for guests with a comfy double bed, a window seat and a small table for writing or just coffee.    This one room cabin on short stilts sits slightly uphill from the farmstead.  Fully screened it's a wonderful, quiet perch from which to hear, smell, watch and enjoy farm life.  Our private cabin is close to all Berkshire cultural attractions and outdoor activities while nestled on an quiet countryside organic farm. It's a great base for exploration, a romantic hideaway, or a quiet writing retreat.Though you can recharge your laptop or phone, there's no internet connectivity, so your retreat won't be interrupted by squawks, or chirps, except from our rooster, and real, live crickets and tree frogs. The farmhouse is nearby (50 yards), but the cabin is wonderfully private. The cabin's own mini 'lawn' and fire pit are just outside the door. Stroll the farm road, and explore the farm, keeping in mind that it's a working farm.     Hike the maintained Nature Conservancy trail right next to the farm, or just chill in your hideaway.   This retreat is perfect for couples and solo adventurers.It's cozy and rustic--it's a farm!--with a wonderful vibe.   Expect to be awakened by a crowing rooster.   (If field mice, a lowing cow in a nearby field, poison ivy, spiders, grass soaked in morning dew, dogs, a hooting owl or coyote's howl cause you consternation, this is decidedly not for you.)Bathroom is in the main farmhouse (Knock on the door. Don't mind the barking dog.) The cabin has no running water. (Natch, water's available in the house.) Dine out at any of the numerous, great south Berkshire eateries: There's a great cafe five minutes away for cappuccino, muffins or a breakfast sannie and a dozen terrific restaurants within 20 minutes. ...or...   Bring your own gear (camp stove, pan and dishes) to prep and cook your meal at the fire pit--that's the 'rough' camping part!   We can provide some materials if you need: firewood, charcoal, organic pasture-raised meats, organic veggies, eggs, etc. as seasonally available (separate charges).

Please check with me if you are adding firewood less than 5 days out.This is easy car access to a raw outdoor camping experience.  You will be camping next to the crystal clear Washougal River and have access to Naked Falls and Reeder Falls.  The camping area is on the East side of the river.  There are 8 excellent camping sites.  Come prepared as the nearest potable water source is at least a mile away and you won't see any lights or electrical outlets on the property.   There is a portable toilet now between sites 4 and 5 on the east side of the road.   Also, please remember that I don't live there and there is limited service on the property.  If you have questions, please contact me in advance as I may be unreachable when you arrive at the property.  If you are not familiar with the area, or even if you haven't camped there before, I recommend contacting me for directions or information about the area before you go up.   Also, if you have an RV, you will want to contact me to discuss which site you really want to book depending on the size of your RV, awnings, slide outs, etc.   Each booked site is allowed 2 cars or 1 RV.   If you have more than 2 cars or 1 RV, there is a fee of 10.00 per additional vehicle.    The Campsites go in the order they appear as you drive through the campground.   There are signs with the site numbers next to each site.   The sites each have their own parking spaces. Please see the brief descriptions below so you have a good idea of what kind of experience you can expect at each site.Site 1: Saltness CreekThis is the only site with direct trail access to the river on the camping side.   It's also right on a creek and encompasses a corner of the confluence of the creek and the Washougal River.   It's a nice open space right off the gravel road which allows you to park right by where you will set up tents and have your campfire.   It also means other campers will drive right by your site and they will need to pass by it to take the trail to the river.   This site is very convenient but not very private.Site 2: Naked FallsThere is a short narrow trail that leads to the campsite on the Naked Falls cliff.   It's awesome!   This is the original campsite at Naked Falls and has likely been there for 100 years or more.   It overlooks the waterfall and island downstream.   It's really the coolest campsite but it's not for everybody.   The area for pitching tents is smaller than at the other sites.   Only 2 medium sized tents will fit comfortably.   You may be able to cram 3 tents in but should be aware that it's only really meant for 2.   Groups larger than 6 may want to consider another site.   Also, it is right on the cliff where people like to jump so, while you have the best view of all the fun stuff happening at the falls, you also have cliff divers coming up to say hi during the day. Site 3: Desk JobThis site is just past the falls.   It has a wide short trail to the camping area and a beautiful view of the river that passes right by the site about 30 ft below it.   It is nice, quiet and secluded. Site 4: Middle ManagementThis site is nice for pulling vehicles in and around.   It loops around some trees in the center.   The trees to the east and North  are all alders so it has limited shade in the morning  when there aren't leaves on the trees (winter and early spring)   The trail down is wide and short.   There is a small opening with a nice view of the river and it's quiet.   A great place to listen to the flow of the river and the beat of your heart.    Site 5: Conference RoomThe Conference Room is tucked into the woods a little more than the other sites.   It's right over the river just like all the rest of the sites but the trees like living on that cliff...like a whole bunch.   You can walk to the edge and see the river but it's not the most open view of the river.   I love this site.   It has two old growth stumps from the first harvest ever at Naked Falls.   They tell stories of the Yacolt burn and a lot of hard winters.   A short narrow trail get's you from your car to to the camping area in about 20 steps.Site 6: Printer JamThis site is quite large and has the most extensive view of the river.   Great for bigger groups or bigger tents.   This is a chill spot where you can roast marshmallows while watching the flow of the Washougal River 35 ft below.Site 7: Budget MeetingThe last site on the road has the longest walk...about 50 yards.   It is also a large space and is the most secluded.   It's the longest distance from river access but also the most private.   The walk down passes an old growth tree that must have fallen decades ago.   It has a huge base and the root structure is about 12 ft tall.   There are a variety of trees that hug this campsite.   If you don't mind the walk, you are sure to dig the vibe at our version of a Budget Meeting.Site 8: The Slash PilePlease read this full description before booking.   I'm giving this site a go because I think it's a rather unique experience for the right people.   This site sits up above all the other sites.   It is not on a river but has a river view and view of all the other campsites.   It is surrounded by a slash pile which is the wood debris left over from logging.   You can drive right to it but only if you have 4wd/AWD.   The road is also surrounded by alder trees that might slap the side of your car as you go up so if you are concerned about that, this is not the spot for you.   There is not much shade up there either.   You may want to bring a shade tent.   The site is fairly large and has plenty of room for tents but I don't recommend any trailers or RVs here due to the steep rocky road.   Your walk to the river will be about as long as the walk from site 7.   It will be an easy walk down and a bit of a trek up.   If no one books this site, I will totally understand but It's a cool spot if you are cool with the challenges it presents.", :lat=>45.6827, :lng=>-122.1313, :image_url=>"naked-falls"})

The ideal location that allow's easy access to hot springs, fishing, swimming, and easy \"in and out\" to go visit the local sites.   *Be prepared/aware  to see other residents, campers, hikers and fisherfolk walk through the upper part of the campsite to access the trail to river and hot springs.   However, the site is so large you will hardly notice them if you don't camp right next to the trail.   There is no doubt, that this site will provide nothing less than a stellar outdoor experience on any level you roll!          *This campsite is awesome for large groups and  is connected to the network of trails on the property  that are a good adventure during your stay.

We are also granting a  30% weekday overnight stay discount!   Please contact us for  changing weather  conditions and questions.   Looking forward to a spectacular spring season 2020!Camp or hideout like Butch Cassidy's Wild Bunch probably did at the   Hiawatha Hideout located ~20 miles south of the infamous \"Castle Gate hold up\"   that was staged on April 21, 1897,   at the mouth of Price Canyon in east-central Utah.   The hideout is a cattle  ranch and a lot more that is   strategically located for group-friendly unlimited hiking, biking, horseback riding, photography, wildlife viewing  and general exploration in and around  Utah's (less well-known, yet truly spectacular) San Rafael Swell wilderness and recreation areas!    Butch and Sundance spent time here and  you should too!   Located 15 miles (as the crow flies) from the San Rafael Swell's   \"Wedge Overlook\" (aka Little Grand Canyon) and within easy striking distance  of  the Buckhorn Wash, Cedar Mountain, Tavaputs Plateau, Huntington Reservoir, Electric Lake,   Scofield Reservoir, Joe's Valley Reservoir   as well as countless other recreational sites in Carbon and Emery County!   Check out the petroglyphs and pictographs of nearby Nine Mile Canyon (largest collection on earth) or stay put and visit what's left of  the ranch's original homestead, early European settler's stone buildings,  prehistoric Fremont Indian pit houses, pioneer dugouts or simply enjoy the spectacular topography, wildlife and scenery.     Park the RV at our large group camp site (120 vac is available) and prep the mountain bikes and lace up your hiking boots or jogging shoes.   Maybe kick back and enjoying a quiet evening around the  large group camp bonfire!   Later, take one of the  unimproved trails for an off-the-grid reclusive expedition or look for  that perfect  remote camp site.   Explore the  tranquil seclusion along picturesque Miller Creek as it courses for a mile bisecting the ranch's > 700 acres.     Cool your feet in the  crystal clear water by noon or  take a nap in the shade of   magnificent riparian cottonwoods.     Check out the 1/2 acre hidden pond and spring!In need of a place for this summer's  family reunion?   This is  the place!     Add an  adventurous sojourn to the  nearby Castle Valley Pageant (held every other summer) just outside the neighboring town of  Orangeville, Utah and  learn about stoic Mormon pioneers who originally settled here!      Experience a grand shootin' time  in an authentically recreated western town with saloon, bank and other out buildings   (Single Action Shooter Society--SASS approved) or practice at  a modern pistol, rifle, long distance and/or archery range at the nearby  world class North  Springs Shooting Range (just 5 miles north and  east of the ranch!).   ATVs?   lots of public state and federal lands surround the ranch to explore.  Got a hunter in the family?   Because the ranch borders a much  sought-after  Utah Cooperative Wildlife Management Unit (CWMU) and is key winter range for large numbers of  mule deer and elk.   Take your favorite hunter  on  a  mid-winter solstice photography exodus and enjoy  once in a lifetime monster trophy  rutting mule deer bucks that will leave even the  most noble big game  hunter speechless!Located  100  miles north and  west of Arches National Park, you'll be perfectly situated for exploring  the entire  San Rafael  Swell!   You'll also be off the well beaten  path  to Moab and Hanksville,  as well as a plethora of national parks, monuments, and state parks (including  Canyonlands,  Capital Reef, Goblin Valley, Horseshoe Canyon,  Glen Canyon National Recreational Area, and Lake Powell to name just a few).     Avoid worrying about full campsites (particularly  on weekends and holidays) as  you'll find the  privacy, safety, and solitude  you're seeking among pinion pines, hundred year old twisted cedar (juniper) trees and crystal blue clear skies!     Close your eyes, feel the cool breeze and take in the scent of a burning cedar campfire.     Bask in splendor while camping on  the east  slope  of the spectacular Manti La Sal National Forest, Star Point  and  Gentry Mountain!  Relax, avoid the traffic, headache, congestion, and noise of better  known and more  heavily visited recreational sites before you head back to civilization!     Isn't that what you really intended to do?       Just one more thing.     Since the ranch is bordered by public BLM and SITLA lands there are literally thousands of additional acres to explore but only accessible through  the ranch  main gate.     And for Pete's sake  don't forget extra fuel, food, clothing and  your camera!     Easy to find the large central group RV campsite is less than 1/4 mile off paved highway 122 just northeast of the ghost town of Hiawatha.   Discover an  historic stone   brothel   (that's right, an honest to goodness \"house of ill repute\" with a  late 1880's  inscription on the back  wall).     Hike, bike, or ride along the historic bed of the  Utah Railway line that connected the towns of Price and Hiawatha via a rare early gasoline propelled locomotive  back in  1912   (lasted only  a few years before an historic flood destroyed its trestles).     Check out the remains of a 100+ year old relic pump house,  spring, and pond that settlers relied on  to irrigate cultivated farm plots on the historic homestead.     Keep an eye out for deer, moose, coyotes, rabbits, golden eagles or a lonesome cowboy moving cattle along your path.   Wake early and stay up late for a spectacular summer sunrise and sunset under an authentic Navajo   \"Chaha'oh\"   (summer shade hut) at the main group campsite.     Corral and rest your horses in one of three enclosures outfitted with automatic waters, feed tubs, and onsite alfalfa/grass 2 string bales   ($10/bale).     And don't forget to take a dip in one of the two solar-powered  cattle watering troughs if it gets too hot!  Check out (or by special arrangement, sleep in) a traditional  Native American built female Navajo  hogan with  a fully functional wood/coal pot-belly stove or be spiritually cleansed in the adjacent Navajo sweat lodge.     You could choose the 16-foot Plains Indian  canvas tepee with its  central fire pit or  an absolutely gorgeous vintage restored   1920's sheep camp (our favorite)  or simply throw out  your bed roll under the stars about anywhere!The Hiawatha Hideout Ranch is a picturesque,  convenient and  well-hidden  secret in Utah's east central high desert and that's how we intend to  keep it!

Pack out what you bring in.  You will be about 25 miles from the gates to Big Bend National Park and Big Bend Ranch State Park, about a 45 minute drive. But you will not have noisy \"neighbors\", generators or traffic!NOTE:  Some of the campsites will have a view of the back of the dam. This dam was created using our \"THREE R\" philosophy of \"REUSE, REPURPOSE & RECYCLE everything, so as to RESPECT the planet.

We are very secluded & private, with virtually no nighttime \"light pollution\", so you can view our awesome night sky. This, plus our location, affords a 360 degree panoramic view of the legendary Big Bend night sky.The camping/RV parking area is about 150 yards from the main house, on a point of land overlooking our unique \"mini badlands\", a 15 acre arroyo. Spectacular views of many mountains are in every direction, with 4885' Agua Fria dominating from about five miles to the southwest.Sunrise is a spectacular event, made more quaint by the gentle crowing of our roosters, who sometimes think sunrise is arriving far earlier. You are about 150 yards from them though! Sunset is the same. The campground has uninhibited views of both events and if you are lucky enough to be here during the 3-4 days of the full moon, moonrise is a once-in-a-lifetime event!Many new campgrounds are popping up in the Big Bend area. Many, unfortunately,   are \"corporate\" ones, owned by a large corporation with an employee manager. We are an owner-operated, \"Mom & Pop\" campground where your stay with us is appreciated & the income needed & re-invested locally. Most of the area remains \"Mom & Pop\", but the corporations are finding the area and \"Taos-ing\" it gradually. NOT HERE and the difference is obvious!It is rustic camping. We graded and improved the campsites in November, adding firepits, clearing brush, making our campground as nice as possible! Cosmetic improvement work on the entire area will be ongoing. The toilet, kitchen and sitting areas are in a 26' travel trailer for all to use. This was just placed on the campground in April and needs some work, like running water, which is coming Spring of 2020..... until then there are always containers of water available in the trailer, as well as running water at the main house.  This is a 100% off-grid ranch! We can provide limited electrical power from a small solar electric system in the travel trailer, 100% off grid! However, you CANNOT run an RV refrigerator, electric heat, or air conditioning. Medical devices like a CPAP machine will require 200' of extension cord, as due to their high wattage demands, must be connected to the main ranch electrical system.Hikers can explore many miles of road, but must bear in mind that in Texas, ALL land is privately owned and you must be respectful of that at all times. We are also 3 miles from a spring-fed \"swimming hole\" that may be enjoyed, so long as you respect the land and pack out what you pack in. The Big Bend Parks are about 25 miles from here. The McDonald Observatory is about 100 miles from here and the mysterious \"Marfa Lights\" about 80 miles from us....... but still close enough that some stray into view at times.By the way, our pricing is allowing for ONE tent, trailer, or RV per 8 of the 9   campsites, with no more than 6 people total. However, we just built one large site with a long driveway. This site can accommodate up to twelve people, three tents and four vehicles. To book this site, we have a separate listing as \"Eco-Ranch Large Group Camping\". Just go there to reserve this site.We are retired, which means older hosts. We get tired in the evenings. This is also a working poultry farm, which requires our attention in the early morning and early evening. We request that campers arrive BEFORE 5:00 PM, as we have to attend to our farm as our first priority. You may arrive later, but there are no lights in the camping area, so setting up your stuff can be difficult after dark & we won't be able to help or do a proper \"meet & greet\" until morning.PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE...â\u0080¦.. DO NOT try to come here using a map program or GPS unit!!!! These will route you down non-existent or impassable \"roads\".

Also a price increase from last year, however, if you are a returning camper, just let me know and I will refund the increase so your stay will be the same as last year.Imagine looking out into the crystal clear waters of the Wild and Scenic Smith River that appear emerald green from afar. This is because of the rare green serpentine rocks below that cast their magical color. Think of watching the native osprey diving for fish, merganser ducks and their ducklings taking shelter on the sandbar, otter swimming below to hunt fish and crawdads, kingfishers chattering as they fly upriver, blue and white heron  standing as sentinels on the rocks, and occasionally bald eagles perching on the snags across the river. These are right at your doorstep as you take the trail down to the river for a brisk morning plunge or later to enjoy sitting in the sun. The sound of small waterfalls cascade nearby to lull your senses into relaxation. The rock and cement trail lined with fern, thimble berry, native azaleas, stream orchids, and myrtlewood, take you to a cement pad where a ladder into the river awaits your use. You can dive in and swim over to the sandbar or to the nearby cliffs and try your hand at jumping off the highest rocks. Air mattresses for floating and lounge chairs are set up for your use as well. Or if you'd rather use your own kayak or paddle board, feel free to do so. When bathing in the Smith, please only use biodegradable soap to help keep the Smith pristine. There is liquid soap for your use at the river. According to siskiyouland.org\"The Smith River is the wildest and cleanest river in the country outside of Alaska â\u0080\u0094 indeed, it is one of the cleanest rivers in the world. â\u0080\u0094 The Smith is the only major undammed river in California. â\u0080\u0093The Smith River watershed contains a higher percentage of unlogged, original ancient forest ecosystem than any other river in California.\"If you would prefer to wander the grounds, there are meandering paths that let you enjoy the beautiful flowers and landscaped yard where something is always blooming. A lawn in front is perfect for bocce ball, \"washoe,\" or croquet, which the host will provide upon request. Next to the tent site is a large redwood picnic table and a fire pit for roasting hot dogs, marshmallows, or cooking. A Weber BBQ is available around the side of the house next to a small man made waterfall and streambed. There is also a redwood deck with lounge chairs and another table.      Nearby you can bicycle, hike, or you can drive to the beach, just 22 miles away. Both Crescent City and Brookings are close by. The redwoods are literally down the road, where you can hike many trails and see one of the largest redwood trees on record at Stout Grove. If you are a  Star Wars   fan, you will recognize scenes filmed there. You might even see an Ewok spying on you from around a tree! The local Forest Service Station in Gasquet, just up the road from the host's site, has lots of maps and free advice of what to do and where to   go, just  ask  the  host. She  knows  most of  the best local spots.       If you'd like to float on air mattresses or inner tubes, you can arrange with  the host for a small fee, to take you up to the Forks of the Smith where you can enter the river and float down to the house. It is about a half hour float, but it gets rocky in mid summer and isn't recommended for kids.  A longer float will take you down river to the Mary Adams Peacock Bridge where pick up by the host can be arranged.         Fishing for trout and steelhead can be done from the cement platform or kayak, but please make sure to have a California license.          A local hike to Stoney Creek allows you to view the native carnivorous plants, called Darlingtonia or \"Pitcher Plant\". There are numerous patches of them growing along the stream beds and seeps. Swimming up the North Fork is a great destination hike as well, which is just up from Stoney Creek.        Madam Gasquet's grave site is above the Forks of the Smith, about a mile from the host's home. The view looking down at the forks is spectacular. This is an easy walk.   There is a large intact male Shiloh Shepherd on site who is very friendly. However if you are afraid of big dogs, this may not be the spot for you. This is his home, though he will not be out wandering into your camp, as he sticks pretty close by the host's side.There is spotty WIFI outside and the only cell service is US Cellular. Verizon works occasionally but no AT&T.

Plan on bringing layers of clothing as temperatures can go from hot and warm during the day, to quite cool and even cold after dark.  The Klamath River is swift moving (usually about 7 knots, and strong).  It runs 286 miles from Klamath Falls, OR to the sea.  There are four tributaries: the Scott, Shasta, Trinity and Salmon Rivers.  Swimming in the summer months is delicious.  We have mostly pebbly beaches and a sandy spot upstream near a big rock outcropping that we use for diving.  The river is chilly until late June and it cools down again in late September. NEIGHBORSThere are very few neighbors in this area. The Yurok village of Wautek is directly across the river from Otter Space.  (The non-native name for Wautek is Johnsonâ\u0080\u0099s Bar, which used to be a trading post. Ships could get into the mouth of the Klamath and they would send boats upstream to trade with the Yurok for pelts and fish, etc. In the late 1800â\u0080\u0099s silt build up made it impossible for trading vessels to come into the river, so the trading dried up.)  We also have a couple of neighbors who live on the property next to our meadow on the other side of our organic fruit orchard. Please use our path ways to travel, and respect the privacy and tranquility of our neighbors by not keeping late hours or playing loud music.

Joe and Wendy Moore have been living sustainably off the land for over a decade (you can watch their YouTube video â\u0080\u0093 Off The Grid in Kansas In A Straw Bale House III).   They have lived a life together with a focus on being as self sufficient as possible.   Food is the most important thing to consider; so, Organic Gardening was the first step down the long and winding rabbit hole.  And soon (as one thing leads to another) their eyes were opened to the importance of Saving Open Pollenated Seeds, Heirloom Varieties, and Food Preservation methods such as Pressure Canning, Dehydrating, Smoking, and Root Cellars.  Next, the question of how to build a Natural and Affordable Shelter.  First, they built a beautiful  Cob House (the largest cob house in America at the time) but, choosing to relocate, they then built (as you may have already seen from the video) an amazing, round, Straw-bale House; complete with a summer kitchen, hand dug well,  and a hand dug root cellar.  Here they managed a nice family farm and tended a 2 acre garden; made possible with a Work Horse trained by a nearby Amish Community.  Animal Husbandry is part of the deal, so dairy goats, fiber goats and sheep, cows, chickens, turkeys, and even a couple of bee hives, accompanied the horses.  The  skills acquired from their furry teachers include: Homemade Goat Milk Soap, Dairy Products such as Cheese, Butter and Yogurt ect., Spinning Wool into yarn and Crocheting it into something beautiful and useable; Butchering (sorry vegetarians) and Tanning Hides.Still seeking to live more sustainably, Joe and Wendy looked further into the past, with many answers found in the Native American lifestyle (prior to the impact of the white man).  These skills include Flintknapping, Bow-Drill Fire Building, Archery, Primitive Shelters, Wild Edibles, Natural and Alternative Healing, Sweat Lodge Ceremony and Native Indigenous Peoples Philosophy.  Joe has rounded off his education in the high tech world of alternative energy- Solar, Wind, & Water.  His off grid home and life style are greatly complimented with his knowledge of primitive technology such as Rocket Stoves, Mass Heaters, and Cob Ovens.Joe and Wendy now live at Otter Space with their three children, and we have the benefit of their expertise when you come to camp. Take advantage of this unique learning opportunity by attending any of their workshops; or, you can personalize a workshop according to your interest in any of the skills listed above.  Just give them a little advanced notice and they will be happy to oblige if possible.WORKSHOPSYou can enroll in any of the workshops below for a half-day session (2-4hrs) $75/person. Group rate (4 or more) $250. Children 12 and under are freeWild Edibles: Knowing that Stinging Nettles taste like spinach, are nutritious and harmless when lightly-steamed, could save someone's life. Learning about, and tending the wild perennial food supply, to help return balance to the Earth, is what it's all about. Courses include roaming the forest, gathering, and preparing a sustainable harvest.Fishing: The Klamath River is well known for its world-class fishing for salmon and steelhead. The infamous \"half-pounders\" arrive in July (anything under 3 pounds is called a half-pounder) followed by a nice run of salmon in September. Rod, tackle and bait included. Custom smoking is available if you catch the big one!Archery: Wendy's parents met at an archery tournament in Southern California almost 50 years ago. Might mention that her father took the championship; so the fundamental techniques of archery were taught to her at a young age, and is something she still enjoys and practices today. Courses include bow rental, arrows (handmade by Joe), and plenty of target practice. Flying target contest with flu flu arrows for a finale! Fun for all... bring the whole clan for a family discount.Primitive Fire Building: Bow Drill/ Flint & Steel: What an awesome technology; rubbing two sticks together to the extreme! Making fire without a lighter is something most people can no longer do. Materials are the key... you will take home the knowledge, the bow drill you make, and a nice piece of flint.Flint Knapping:  The art of flint knapping is controlled demolition of stone. It is an art that all of our ancestors engaged in at one time or another. This connection is felt on a very real level every time you produce a tool out of stone. Classes include hands on learning of direct percussion, indirect percussion (Joe's favorite) and pressure flaking with primitive antler or modern copper. All tools and rock provided, with additional rock available for purchase. Cob building: Probably the most beautiful, natural, and efficient form of shelter ever invented. Joe and Wendy built the largest cob house in America at the time, 30x40 with walls 2 foot thick. It also had cob interior walls and a cob floor. Although cob is probably the best long-term natural building material, it is very labor intense. Courses include discussion on materials involved, hands on mixing, and building a small section of wall.  (Full day $500 minimum... advance notice required)Cob oven: Have you ever had bread from a masonry oven? Something a conventional oven just can't reproduce. Beautiful and functional, Cob ovens are something everyone should have in their backyard. This is going to be a full day workshop! Plan on getting your feet and hands a little muddy; but, at the end of the day, you will walk away with all the knowledge you need to build your own awesome, outdoor oven.  (Full day $500 minimum... advance notice required)Straw-bale building: You can see my video... speaks for itself. Straw-bale is a great, quick building material that looks and feels like a cob house with only a fraction of the labor. If people realized the superior insulation value alone of the Straw-bale house, the stick house would be a thing of the past. Perfect for dry climates, like Southern California, as it's only downfall is sensitivity to moisture. Offered in full day courses that include discussion of materials, and hands on building and plastering.

Neighbors are nearby but not visible due to the lush environment and large neighboring acreages. The air is clean and fresh as we are 5 miles from the ocean and surrounded by  forests. As far as history, our land was logged in 1915 and several old growth stumps are scattered on the property as evidence. Since then the forest has regrown and the young trees are already hundreds of feet tall. A twenty minute bike ride or five minute car ride will bring you to one of two nearby towns, and spectacular beaches are also close by.

Joe and Wendy Moore have been living sustainably off the land for over a decade (you can watch their YouTube video â\u0080\u0093 Off The Grid in Kansas In A Straw Bale House III). They have lived a life together with a focus on being as self sufficient as possible. Food is the most important thing to consider; so, Organic Gardening was the first step down the long and winding rabbit hole. And soon (as one thing leads to another) their eyes were opened to the importance of Saving Open Pollenated Seeds, Heirloom Varieties, and Food Preservation methods such as Pressure Canning, Dehydrating, Smoking, and Root Cellars. Next, the question of how to build a Natural and Affordable Shelter. First, they built a beautiful Cob House (the largest cob house in America at the time) but, choosing to relocate, they then built (as you may have already seen from the video) an amazing, round, Straw-bale House; complete with a summer kitchen, hand dug well, and a hand dug root cellar. Here they managed a nice family farm and tended a 2 acre garden; made possible with a Work Horse trained by a nearby Amish Community. Animal Husbandry is part of the deal, so dairy goats, fiber goats and sheep, cows, chickens, turkeys, and even a couple of bee hives, accompanied the horses. The skills acquired from their furry teachers include: Homemade Goat Milk Soap, Dairy Products such as Cheese, Butter and Yogurt ect., Spinning Wool into yarn and Crocheting it into something beautiful and useable; Butchering (sorry vegetarians) and Tanning Hides.Still seeking to live more sustainably, Joe and Wendy looked further into the past, with many answers found in the Native American lifestyle (prior to the impact of the white man). These skills include Flintknapping, Bow-Drill Fire Building, Archery, Primitive Shelters, Wild Edibles, Natural and Alternative Healing, Sweat Lodge Ceremony and Native Indigenous Peoples Philosophy. Joe has rounded off his education in the high tech world of alternative energy- Solar, Wind, & Water. His off grid home and life style are greatly complimented with his knowledge of primitive technology such as Rocket Stoves, Mass Heaters, and Cob Ovens.Joe and Wendy now live at Otter Space with their three children, and we have the benefit of their expertise when you come to camp. Take advantage of this unique learning opportunity by attending any of their workshops; or, you can personalize a workshop according to your interest in any of the skills listed above. Just give them a little advanced notice and they will be happy to oblige if possible.WORKSHOPSYou can enroll in any of the workshops below for a half-day session (2-4hrs) $75/person. Group rate (4 or more) $250. Children 12 and under are freeWild Edibles: Knowing that Stinging Nettles taste like spinach, are nutritious and harmless when lightly-steamed, could save someone's life. Learning about, and tending the wild perennial food supply, to help return balance to the Earth, is what it's all about. Courses include roaming the forest, gathering, and preparing a sustainable harvest.Fishing: The Klamath River is well known for its world-class fishing for salmon and steelhead. The infamous \"half-pounders\" arrive in July (anything under 3 pounds is called a half-pounder) followed by a nice run of salmon in September. Rod, tackle and bait included. Custom smoking is available if you catch the big one!Archery: Wendy's parents met at an archery tournament in Southern California almost 50 years ago. Might mention that her father took the championship; so the fundamental techniques of archery were taught to her at a young age, and is something she still enjoys and practices today. Courses include bow rental, arrows (handmade by Joe), and plenty of target practice. Flying target contest with flu flu arrows for a finale! Fun for all... bring the whole clan for a family discount.Primitive Fire Building: Bow Drill/ Flint & Steel: What an awesome technology; rubbing two sticks together to the extreme! Making fire without a lighter is something most people can no longer do. Materials are the key... you will take home the knowledge, the bow drill you make, and a nice piece of flint.Flint Knapping: The art of flint knapping is controlled demolition of stone. It is an art that all of our ancestors engaged in at one time or another. This connection is felt on a very real level every time you produce a tool out of stone. Classes include hands on learning of direct percussion, indirect percussion (Joe's favorite) and pressure flaking with primitive antler or modern copper. All tools and rock provided, with additional rock available for purchase.Cob building: Probably the most beautiful, natural, and efficient form of shelter ever invented. Joe and Wendy built the largest cob house in America at the time, 30x40 with walls 2 foot thick. It also had cob interior walls and a cob floor. Although cob is probably the best long-term natural building material, it is very labor intense. Courses include discussion on materials involved, hands on mixing, and building a small section of wall. (Full day $500 minimum... advance notice required)Cob oven: Have you ever had bread from a masonry oven? Something a conventional oven just can't reproduce. Beautiful and functional, Cob ovens are something everyone should have in their backyard. This is going to be a full day workshop! Plan on getting your feet and hands a little muddy; but, at the end of the day, you will walk away with all the knowledge you need to build your own awesome, outdoor oven. (Full day $500 minimum... advance notice required)Straw-bale building: You can see my video... speaks for itself. Straw-bale is a great, quick building material that looks and feels like a cob house with only a fraction of the labor. If people realized the superior insulation value alone of the Straw-bale house, the stick house would be a thing of the past. Perfect for dry climates, like Southern California, as it's only downfall is sensitivity to moisture. Offered in full day courses that include discussion of materials, and hands on building and plastering. ( $500 minimum... advance notice required)MORE ABOUT OTTER SPACE...The Otter Space Conference Center was purchased in 2002 by Dr. Peter Alsop as a place of peace and healing, where human service professionals come to train with Dr. Alsop and learn how to help children and families cope with issues such as chemical dependency, loss and grief, child abuse and trauma", :lat=>41.3458, :lng=>-123.8646, :image_url=>"otter-space-deer-meadow-camp"})

Custom smoking is available if you catch the big one!Archery: Wendy's parents met at an archery tournament in Southern California almost 50 years ago. Might mention that her father took the championship; so the fundamental techniques of archery were taught to her at a young age, and is something she still enjoys and practices today. Courses include bow rental, arrows (handmade by Joe), and plenty of target practice. Flying target contest with flu flu arrows for a finale! Fun for all... bring the whole clan for a family discount.Primitive Fire Building: Bow Drill/ Flint & Steel: What an awesome technology; rubbing two sticks together to the extreme! Making fire without a lighter is something most people can no longer do. Materials are the key... you will take home the knowledge, the bow drill you make, and a nice piece of flint.Flint Knapping:  The art of flint knapping is controlled demolition of stone. It is an art that all of our ancestors engaged in at one time or another. This connection is felt on a very real level every time you produce a tool out of stone. Classes include hands on learning of direct percussion, indirect percussion (Joe's favorite) and pressure flaking with primitive antler or modern copper. All tools and rock provided, with additional rock available for purchase. Cob building: Probably the most beautiful, natural, and efficient form of shelter ever invented. Joe and Wendy built the largest cob house in America at the time, 30x40 with walls 2 foot thick. It also had cob interior walls and a cob floor. Although cob is probably the best long-term natural building material, it is very labor intense. Courses include discussion on materials involved, hands on mixing, and building a small section of wall.  (Full day $500 minimum... advance notice required)Cob oven: Have you ever had bread from a masonry oven? Something a conventional oven just can't reproduce. Beautiful and functional, Cob ovens are something everyone should have in their backyard. This is going to be a full day workshop! Plan on getting your feet and hands a little muddy; but, at the end of the day, you will walk away with all the knowledge you need to build your own awesome, outdoor oven.  (Full day $500 minimum... advance notice required)Straw-bale building: You can see my video... speaks for itself. Straw-bale is a great, quick building material that looks and feels like a cob house with only a fraction of the labor. If people realized the superior insulation value alone of the Straw-bale house, the stick house would be a thing of the past.

Sometimes we see timid black bears and we often have black-tail deer in the meadow. We are surrounded by old trails made by the lumber companies 80 years ago when the clear cut all the old growth redwood on our side of the mountain, and now it's completely reforested with 200 ft tall Doug Fir, Madrone, Cedar, Oak, the pine species and Pepper wood trees.  HIPCAMP â\u0080\u0093 OTTER SPACEInformation PacketThe Otter Space Conference Center was purchased in 2002 by Dr. Peter Alsop as a place of peace and healing, where human service professionals come to train with Dr. Alsop and learn how to help children and families cope with issues such as chemical dependency, loss and grief, child abuse and trauma. We are located on the Yurok Indian reservation right on the Klamath River just outside Orick, CA. The name Otter Space comes from a family of otters that live just down river. Itâ\u0080\u0099s also combination of â\u0080\u009CArtistâ\u0080\u0099s Spaceâ\u0080\u009D and â\u0080\u009COuter Spaceâ\u0080\u009D and implies the importance of thinking â\u0080\u009Cout of the boxâ\u0080\u009D and valuing music and the arts in healing and living our lives fully, as well as the need to pass on earth and people-friendly skills to help our children survive into the future.Our Main House was built in 1952 and retains the flavor of the 50â\u0080\u0099s. It houses a kitchen, dining hall, a living room, two bedrooms and a bathroom with a bathtub and shower. It currently houses Joe and Wendy Moore and their three children. Joe and Wendy live sustainably off the land and offer workshops on a number of sustainable practices. They will be available to help if help is needed. They also have emergency phone service to the outside world, â\u0080¦ emphasis on â\u0080\u009Cemergencyâ\u0080\u009D.The Barn has two bedrooms upstairs with a shared bathroom, and workshop below.HIPCAMP SITESOur Pumpkin Cottage and our Blue Cottage each sleep 4 people, (or 6 people if 2 donâ\u0080\u0099t mind sleeping on the floor and being crowded.) They each have running hot and cold water and a wood stove for heat. If you use our Cottages, we expect campers to have their own sleeping bags. We have beds with mattresses. If you would like to have clean bedding, there is an extra fee for pillows, blankets, sheets and towels for $12.00 per person. Please let us know in advance.We have also opened our 2-Story Riverview Yurt for folks who want a full kitchen, a private shower and flush toilet overlooking the Klamath river from the 50 x 50 foot deck. Luscious to sit outside and watch the river flow by during the day, and to let the water lull you to sleep at night. For families (up to 8), old friends, folks who like to fish, or just for a very special get-away.If you are camping in one of our Meadow Camps, our Maple Riverview or Pepperwood Riverview Camps or our Romantic Teepee, you may want to bring your camper van or smaller RV to the campsite. Depending on the size of your vehicle, you may be able to park in the meadow, next to your camp, or up at the main house, and pitch your tent in the site youâ\u0080\u0099ve reserved.Our Shower House next to the Cottages. It has two separate sides, each with a toilet, sink and shower with on demand hot water. There is also an outhouse at the bottom of the road down to the meadow, which is closer to the Riverview, Meadow and River Teepee Camps. Feel free to piss outside (with discretion if there are other campers present), for any solid waste, please use the appropriate accommodations. Any campers can use the shower house. Please be considerate of others.TIMES Please clean up and check out of your site by 11:am on the day of your departure. You can check in by 1:p on the day of your arrival.CLIMATE & THE KLAMATH Otter Space is in what many call the â\u0080\u009Cbanana beltâ\u0080\u009D of the Humboldt rainforest. Plan on bringing layers of clothing as temperatures can go from hot and warm during the day, to quite cool and even cold after dark. The Klamath River is swift moving (usually about 7 knots, and strong). It runs 286 miles from Klamath Falls, OR to the sea. There are four tributaries: Scott, Shasta, Trinity and Salmon Rivers. Swimming in the summer months is delicious. We have mostly pebbly beaches and a sandy spot upstream near a big rock outcropping that we use for diving. The river is chilly until late June and it cools down again in late September. NEIGHBORS There are very few neighbors in this area. The Yurok village of Wautek is directly across the river from Otter Space. (Non-native name for Wautek is Johnsonâ\u0080\u0099s Bar, which used to be a trading post. Ships could get into the mouth of the Klamath and they would send boats upstream to trade with the Yurok for pelts and fish, etc. In the late 1800â\u0080\u0099s silt build up made it impossible for trading vessels to come into the river, so the trading dried up.) We also have a couple of neighbors who live on the property next to our meadow on the other side of our organic fruit orchard. Please use our pathways to travel property next to us, and respect the privacy and tranquility of our neighbors by not keeping late hours or playing loud music. COMMUNICATIONS We are in a remote area and do not have easy access to telecommunications systems. Regular cell phones do not work at Otter Space. This is not an inconvenience; itâ\u0080\u0099s an opportunity to notice how dependent we have become on our electronic connections! We suggest that you make arrangements to be entirely unreachable while you are in Otter Space, and see if the world can get by without your assistance.EMERGENCIES If someone needs to reach you in an emergency, they can call 913. 424. 8370. and leave a message. We will check messages at least once a day. This number is a special cel phone and outgoing calls will be made for emergencies only. If you need first aid beyond your own resources, please find Joe or Wendy in the Yurt, as they both have training in alternative medicines and will have some supplies or resources that could help. If you are in any way uncomfortable with their suggestions, please let them know and they will call for outside help without a second request. In extreme situations, we can call Humboldt CHP at 707. 268. 2000. They will dispatch the first available medevac helicopter, who will know which hospital is available; Mad River Hosp./Arcata - St. Joseph's Hosp./Eureka - Sutter Coast Hosp./Crescent City. Sutter Hospital can arrange a fixed wing airplane medevac from one of these sites to other facilities for treatment beyond what is offered locally. FOOD & WATER Please bring your own food, as the nearest market is an hour away in Orick. Our water was last checked in March, and we got a clean bill of health with regard to everything except the usual â\u0080\u009Ccoliformâ\u0080\u009D count. Coliform is present in all the untreated ground water in our area. The Klamath is green because of the blue-green algae and the coliform. This does not mean that drinking it will make you ill. All the local people drink the local water, including Joe & Wendy and their kids and our other neighbors. The officials said itâ\u0080\u0099s fine for bathing or cooking, but if you are nervous about drinking the water here, please pack in yo", :lat=>41.3469, :lng=>-123.8671, :image_url=>"otter-space-maple-river-camp"})

Joe and Wendy Moore have been living sustainably off the land for over a decade (you can watch their YouTube video â\u0080\u0093 Off The Grid in Kansas In A Straw Bale House III). They have lived a life together with a focus on being as self sufficient as possible. Food is the most important thing to consider; so, Organic Gardening was the first step down the long and winding rabbit hole. And soon (as one thing leads to another) their eyes were opened to the importance of Saving Open Pollenated Seeds, Heirloom Varieties, and Food Preservation methods such as Pressure Canning, Dehydrating, Smoking, and Root Cellars. Next, the question of how to build a Natural and Affordable Shelter. First, they built a beautiful Cob House (the largest cob house in America at the time) but, choosing to relocate, they then built (as you may have already seen from the video) an amazing, round, Straw-bale House; complete with a summer kitchen, hand dug well, and a hand dug root cellar. Here they managed a nice family farm and tended a 2 acre garden; made possible with a Work Horse trained by a nearby Amish Community. Animal Husbandry is part of the deal, so dairy goats, fiber goats and sheep, cows, chickens, turkeys, and even a couple of bee hives, accompanied the horses. The skills acquired from their furry teachers include: Homemade Goat Milk Soap, Dairy Products such as Cheese, Butter and Yogurt ect., Spinning Wool into yarn and Crocheting it into something beautiful and useable; Butchering (sorry vegetarians) and Tanning Hides.Still seeking to live more sustainably, Joe and Wendy looked further into the past, with many answers found in the Native American lifestyle (prior to the impact of the white man). These skills include Flintknapping, Bow-Drill Fire Building, Archery, Primitive Shelters, Wild Edibles, Natural and Alternative Healing, Sweat Lodge Ceremony and Native Indigenous Peoples Philosophy. Joe has rounded off his education in the high tech world of alternative energy- Solar, Wind, & Water. His off grid home and life style are greatly complimented with his knowledge of primitive technology such as Rocket Stoves, Mass Heaters, and Cob Ovens.Joe and Wendy now live at Otter Space with their three children, and we have the benefit of their expertise when you come to camp. Take advantage of this unique learning opportunity by attending any of their workshops; or, you can personalize a workshop according to your interest in any of the skills listed above. Just give them a little advanced notice and they will be happy to oblige if possible.WORKSHOPSYou can enroll in any of the workshops below for a half-day session (2-4hrs) $75/person. Group rate (4 or more) $250. Children 12 and under are freeWild Edibles: Knowing that Stinging Nettles taste like spinach, are nutritious and harmless when lightly-steamed, could save someone's life. Learning about, and tending the wild perennial food supply, to help return balance to the Earth, is what it's all about. Courses include roaming the forest, gathering, and preparing a sustainable harvest.Fishing: The Klamath River is well known for its world-class fishing for salmon and steelhead. The infamous \"half-pounders\" arrive in July (anything under 3 pounds is called a half-pounder) followed by a nice run of salmon in September. Rod, tackle and bait included.

The oldest and coolest building on the property is a hay barn constructed in the 1800's and one could throw a seeping bag in there for the night as well. The property is 12 1/2 acres with all of the buildings in the north-west corner and the rest of the property is open gently rolling land with oak trees, rock outcroppings and grass. Most of the surrounding properties are of large acreage, so it feels very secluded. There is a nice little trail that goes back to the south-east corner and back approximately 1/3 mile roundtrip. Angus cows #46 and #20 may be encountered when out for a walk. They will be wary of you, as they are of me, watch where you step! I make the loop twice a day with my dogs and find it very relaxing. Winter, spring and early summer will be green with wildflowers everywhere in the spring. Typical of the Sierra foothills, everything will be brown from mid-June through October. In this part of the world, the summer is the longest season with no rain and heat. August temperatures can be over 100 degrees daily. Night time temperatures drop a lot, so at the end of the day the AC can be shut off, the windows opened and a pleasant night's sleep can be had. The whole place is fenced, there is a corral and there is water available for horses if you are traveling with them.The bar2b is located 4 miles from Highway 180 which leads to Sequoia/King's Canyon National Parks. Approximately 20 miles from the entrance station and for cyclists, all up hill. There is a restaurant located within 1/2 mile if you don't feel like cooking or want to sit in the bar and have a drink.My conception of the typical guest for this lodging is people who are traveling to or from the National Parks in need of a bed, a place to bath, minimal cooking facilities, and a quiet place to sit out on the deck with a cold drink.

Dear All, we  look forward  to having you camp with us in 2020! Please read through the entire listing to find out more about the Sierra Stream  Camper and our place. Can't wait to hear from  you and to be part of  your  adventures in the Sierra!The Sierra Stream camper, our latest seriously cool Airstream remodel, is designed for a nature-loving couple, but could also accommodate a family with a baby sleeping in with parents. There's a space for a 2-person tent that can be pitched outside the trailer for a nominal fee, if there are additional two people keen on joining you (so up to four guests in total can stay here: two in the trailer and further two tent camping outside), please ask. Just steps away from the lake, the Sierra Stream features a queen size bed with scenic mountain backdrop painted by Veronika and woodwork created by our friend Peter. A full size farmhouse sink, fireplace, library, spectacular view of the mountains and the lake, induction stove, Chemex coffee maker, cozy seating/dining area and hammock are just a few of our favorite features. Fridge, microwave and toaster are also part of the rental.  The kitchen is fully equipped with utensils, cookware, glasses, cups, plates, paper towels, soap, and all the typical kitchenware. An \"oh so cozy\" down comforter, cotton sheets, bath towels, and dish towels are all provided.  Even though Sierra Stream offers many \"luxuries\", it DOES NOT have a toilet or shower. We wanted you to enjoy an open layout with tons of space and close proximity to the lake (this camper is located the closest to the shore). Including the shower/toilet would require hooking this camper up to septic, which wouldn't be possible at the current spot. We believe the location and the view you'll be getting are worth a little walk to our immaculate communal bathrooms (about 100 yards away)  stocked with qtips, razors, cotton balls, lotions and female sanitary products.The camper has a wifi, cooling system, and an outside seating area with fire pit, barbecue and ultra cool camp stove. We also provide one-use supply of charcoal briquettes, to get you set up for your grilling and outdoor entertaining, and you can buy locally grown firewood at our office. So, all you really need to bring is some clothing and food. Pretty much everything else is covered.  We have two kayaks, SUP and paddle boat you can use for free on the reservoir.The rate includes space rent, propane, wifi, one parking spot  as well as 12% Mono County occupancy tax (TOT).  There's an additional flat rate for optional tent camping (regardless if 1 or 2 people camp) - please set the number of campers to three and let us know if 3 or 4  people will be coming to stay. We can also accommodate an extra car, if needed, in our overflow parking. Please message us prior to booking with dates you're hoping to stay with us,  so we can enable the  \"Extra Vehicle Fee\" option for you.  We're a husband and wife team and this is our adopted home - a small RV Park & Campground located directly on the shores of Bridgeport Reservoir. We believe in campfires, starry nights, good laughs, exploration, a deep sleep and an early rise. The mountains are a place to get back to basics, a place to explore, to breathe. So turn off your phone and turn on your senses. When you arrive, we wonâ\u0080\u0099t hand you a list of rules but we may ask you to join us for a campfire, remind you to conserve water, and to separate your trash so we can recycle it.

For the more adventurous, we offer a full slate of self-guided recreational activities such as hiking, kayaking, fishing, ATVing, rock climbing, biking, natural water slides, stand up paddle boards and so much more. Do you enjoy bird watching?

If you come to stay with us at the weekend, you'll be welcome to join us around the campfire and connect with fellow campers (we have fires on most Saturdays, s'mores are on us!)Did we mention that we love dogs? You will see them around the camp. They're strictly not allowed in this camper but we could possibly accommodate one mellow dog if s/he stays with your friends tent camping outside the Airstream.

You might even get to see eggs hatching or newly hatched chicks or ducklings.  Our donkeys, Rosa and Java Joe,  love treats and appreciate campers who bring them carrots and apples *hint hint*We have one tent site at this time.
